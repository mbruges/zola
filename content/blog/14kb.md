Chances are you aren't reading this from a satellite-connected oil-platform, deep in the North Sea, but if you are... *you're welcome*.

Almost all[^1] the `HTML` pages that make up this site weigh in at under *14 kilobytes*.[^2] Why does that matter? Because it's [much faster](https://endtimes.dev/why-your-website-should-be-under-14kb-in-size/) for our imaginary drilling friend.

*For those downloading from the sea ðŸŽ¶*

It's all [terribly complicated](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/id/draft-ietf-quic-recovery-26.html#section-6.8-3), but 14kb is about the maximum amount of data you can wring from your first connection to a web-server[^3]. That means that if your browser can fetch the key components of the webpage in one quick, 14kb round-trip, then you won't need to hang around waiting for the page to load as another round-trip gets underway. 

This isn't worth worrying about most of the time. But if you're some poor soul living off a high-latency satellite connection, those round-trips add up: from laptop, to router, all the way up to a satellite in orbit, back down to a base-station, to a server... then all the way back again. Not to mention the eye-watering data fees.

I'll admit, I don't expect the deep-sea-oil-rig-engineer demographic to be a massive part of this site's audience, but it's good to build something that is as accessible as possible, whatever connection you're on. Nearly [100 million](https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2024-deep-dive-the-state-of-internet-adoption) people came online for the first time last year, and [most of those](https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/mobility-report/articles/enabling-internet-for-all) were on laggy mobile connections and slow hardware. Why waste their money, time and battery-life on junk? 

More than that, [limitations are good](@/blog/markdown.md). Less is more, and killing your darlings - be they `<HTML>` tags or ~superflous~ adjectives - is a healthy practice for any creator. The magic 14kb mark is a precise, achievable target to aim at when building the site.

*"I saw the best webpages of my generation driven mad by React components"*

We get better at things when we have these sorts of clearly-defined and tangible goals. It contextualises decisions and provides a yardstick against which to measure the importance of things. Do I *really* need this chunk of Javascript here? Could this glob of inline `css` be squidged into a stylesheet?

I ended up writing a quick `bash` script to tighten up the *measure-tweak-evaluate* loop. All it does is cycle through the directory of webpages and flag up those over 14kb, but that's all it needs to do. [You can download the script here](/files/bytesize.sh)

*And this screenshot? Exactly 14kb, of course.*

The real work, the editing, is what comes next. And in that spirit of brevity, I'll end here.
