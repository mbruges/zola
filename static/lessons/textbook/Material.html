<p>My mother was a hanky queen<br>
when hanky meant a thing of cloth,<br>
not paper tissues bought in packs<br>
from late-night garages and shops,<br>
but things for waving out of trains<br>
and mopping the corners of your grief:<br>
when hankies were material<br>
she‚Äôd have one, always, up her sleeve.</p>
<p>Tucked in the wrists of every cardi,<br>
a mum‚Äôs embarrassment of lace<br>
embroidered with a V for Viv,<br>
spittled and scrubbed against my face.<br>
And sometimes more than one fell out<br>
as is she had a farm up there<br>
where dried-up hankies fell in love<br>
and mated, raising little squares.</p>
<p>She bought her own; I never did.<br>
Hankies were presents from distant aunts<br>
in boxed sets, with transparent covers<br>
and script initials spelling ponce,<br>
the naffest Christmas gift you‚Äôd get ‚Äì<br>
my brothers too, more often than not,<br>
got male ones: serious, and grey,<br>
and larger, like they had more snot.<br>
It was hankies that closed department stores,<br>
with headscarves, girdles, knitting wool<br>
and trouser presses; homely props<br>
you‚Äôd never find today in malls.<br>
Hankies, which demanded irons,<br>
and boiling to be purified<br>
shuttered the doors of family stores<br>
when those who used to buy them died.</p>
<p>And somehow, with the hanky‚Äôs loss,<br>
greengrocer George with his dodgy foot<br>
delivering veg from a Comma van<br>
is history, and the friendly butcher<br>
who‚Äôd slip an extra sausage in,<br>
the fishmonger whose marble slab<br>
of haddock smoked the colour of yolks<br>
and parcelled rows of local crab</p>
<p>lay opposite the dancing school<br>
where Mrs White, with painted talons,<br>
taught us When You‚Äôre Smiling from<br>
a stumbling, out of tune piano:<br>
step-together, step-together, step-together,<br>
point! The Annual Talent Show<br>
when every mother, fencing tears,<br>
would whip a hanky from their sleeve<br>
and smudge the rouge from little dears.<br>
Nostalgia only makes me old.<br>
The innocence I want my brood<br>
to cling on to like ten-bob notes<br>
was killed in TV‚Äôs lassitude.<br>
And it was me that turned it on and eat<br>
bought biscuits I would bake<br>
if I‚Äôd commit to being home.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs never a hanky up my sleeve.<br>
I raised neglected-looking kids,<br>
the kind whose noses strangers clean.<br>
What awkwardness in me forbids<br>
me to keep tissues in my bag<br>
when handy packs are 50p?<br>
I miss material handkerchiefs,<br>
their soft and hidden history.</p>
<p>But it isn‚Äôt mine. I‚Äôll let it go.<br>
My mother too, eventually,<br>
who died not leaving handkerchiefs<br>
but tissues and uncertainty:<br>
and she would say, should I complain<br>
of the scratchy and disposable,<br>
that this is your material<br>
to do with, daughter, what you will.</p>
