<p>My Uncle Giuseppe told me<br>
that in Sicily in World War Two,<br>
in the courtyard behind the aquarium,<br>
where the bougainvillea grows so well,<br>
the only captive mermaid in the world<br>
was butchered on the dry and dusty ground<br>
by a doctor, a fishmonger, and certain others.</p>
<p>She, it, had never learned to speak<br>
because she was simple, or so they‚Äôd said,<br>
but the priest who held one of her hands<br>
while her throat was cut,<br>
said she was only a fish, and fish can‚Äôt speak.<br>
But she screamed like a woman in terrible fear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="think-aside"></a> Why only &quot;<strong>like</strong> a woman&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And when they took a ripe golden roe<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><br>
from her side, the doctor said<br>
this was proof she was just a fish<br>
and anyway an egg is not a child,<br>
but refused when some was offered to him.</p>
<p>Then they put her head and her hands<br>
in a box for burial<br>
and someone tried to take her wedding ring,<br>
but the others stopped him,<br>
and the ring stayed put.</p>
<p>The rest they cooked and fed to the troops.<br>
They said a large fish had been found on the beach.</p>
<p>Starvation forgives men many things,<br>
my uncle, the aquarium keeper, said,<br>
but couldn‚Äôt look me in the eye,<br>
for which I thank God.</p>
