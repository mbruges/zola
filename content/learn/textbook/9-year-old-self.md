You must forgive me. Don't look so surprised,  
perplexed , and eager to be gone  
balancing on your hands or on the tightrope  
You would rather run than walk, rather climb than run  
rather leap from a height than anything.  
  
I have spoiled this body we once shared.  
Look at the scars, and watch the way I move,  
careful of a bad back or a bruised foot.  
Do you remember how, three minutes after waking  
we'd jump straight out of the ground floor window  
into the summer morning  
  
That dream we had, no doubt it's as fresh in your mind  
as the white paper to write it on.  
We made a start, but something else came up -  
a baby vole, or a bag of sherbet lemons -  
and besides that summer of ambition  
created an ice-lolly factory, a wasp trap  
and a den by a cesspit  
  
I'd like to say we could be friends  
but the truth is we have nothing in common  
beyond a few shared years. I won't keep you then.  
Time to pick rosehips for tuppence a pound,  
time to hide down scared lanes  
from men in cars after girl-children  
or to lunge out over the water  
on the rope that swings from that tree  
long buried in housing -  
But no, I shan't cloud your morning. God knows  
I have fears enough for us both -  
  
I leave you in an ecstasy of concentration  
slowly peeling a ripe scab from your knee  
to taste it on your tongue.
