<p>Her father embarked at sunrise<br>
with a flask of water, a samurai sword<br>
in the cockpit, a shaven head<br>
full of powerful incantations<br>
and enough fuel for a one-way<br>
journey into history</p>
<p>but half way there, she thought,<br>
recounting it later to her children,<br>
he must have looked far down<br>
at the little fishing boats<br>
strung out like bunting<br>
on a green-blue translucent sea</p>
<p>and beneath them, arcing in swathes<br>
like a huge flag waved first one way<br>
then the other in a figure of eight,<br>
the dark shoals of fishes<br>
flashing silver as their bellies<br>
swivelled towards the sun</p>
<p>and remembered how he<br>
and his brothers waiting on the shore<br>
built cairns of pearl-grey pebbles<br>
to see whose withstood longest<br>
the turbulent inrush of breakers<br>
bringing their father‚Äôs boat safe</p>
<p>-- yes, grandfather‚Äôs boat -‚Äì safe<br>
to the shore, salt-sodden, awash<br>
with cloud-marked mackerel,<br>
black crabs, feathery prawns,<br>
the loose silver of whitebait and once<br>
a tuna, the dark prince, muscular, dangerous.</p>
<p>And though he came back<br>
my mother never spoke again<br>
in his presence, nor did she meet his eyes<br>
and the neighbours too, they treated him<br>
as though he no longer existed,<br>
only we children still chattered and laughed</p>
<p>till gradually we too learned<br>
to be silent, to live as though<br>
he had never returned, that this<br>
was no longer the father we loved.<br>
And sometimes, she said, he must have wondered<br>
which had been the better way to die.</p>
