When I hit thirty, he brought me a cake,  
three layers of icing, home-made,  
a candle for each stone in weight.  
  
The icing was white but the letters were pink,  
they said, eat me. And I ate, did  
what I was told. Didnâ€™t even taste it.  
  
Then he asked me to get up and walk  
round the bed so he could watch my broad  
belly wobble, hips judder like a juggernaut.  
  
The bigger the better, heâ€™d say, I like  
big girls, soft girls, girls I can burrow inside  
with multiple chins, masses of cellulite.  
  
I was his Jacuzzi. But he was my cook,  
my only pleasure the rush of fast food,  
his pleasure, to watch me swell like forbidden fruit.  
  
His breadfruit. His desert island after shipwreck.  
Or a beached whale on a king-size bed  
craving a wave. I was a tidal wave of flesh  
  
too fat to leave, too fat to buy a pint of full-fat milk,  
too fat to use fat as an emotional shield,  
too fat to be called chubby, cuddly, big-built.  
The day I hit thirty-nine, I allowed him to stroke  
my globe of a cheek. His flesh, my flesh flowed.  
He said, Open wide, poured olive oil down my throat.  
  
Soon youâ€™ll be fortyâ€¦ he whispered, and how  
could I not roll over on top. I rolled and he drowned  
in my flesh. I drowned his dying sentence out.  
  
I left him there for six hours that felt like a week.  
His mouth slightly open, his eyes bulging with greed.  
There was nothing else left in the house to eat.
