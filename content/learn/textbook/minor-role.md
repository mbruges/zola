Iâ€™m best observed on stage,    
Propping a spear, or making endless    
Exits and entrances with my servantâ€™s    
patter, Yes, sir. O no, sir. If I get    
These midget moments wrong, the monstrous fabric    
Shrinks to unwanted sniggers.    
  
But my heartâ€™s in the unobtrusive,  
The waiting-room roles: driving to hospitals,  
Parking at hospitals. Holding hands under  
Veteran magazines; making sense  
Of consultantsâ€™ monologues; asking pointed  
Questions politely; checking dosages,  
Dates; getting on terms with receptionists;  
Sustaining the background music of civility.  
  
At home in the street you may see me  
Walking fast in case anyone stops:  
getting on, getting better my formula  
For well-meant intrusiveness.  
  
At home,  
Thinking ahead: Bed? A good idea!  
answer the phone,  
Be wary what I say to it, but grateful always;  
Contrive meals for hunger-striker; track down  
Whimsical soft-centred happy-all-the-way-through novels;  
Find the cat (mysteriously reassuring);  
Cancel things; pretend allâ€™s well,  
Admit itâ€™s not. Learn to conjugate all the genres of misery:  
Tears, torpor, boredom, lassitude, yearnings  
For a simpler illness, like a broken leg.  
Enduring ceremonial delays. Being referred  
Somewhere else. Consultantâ€™s holiday. Saying Thank you,  
For anything to everyone  
Not the star part.  
And who would want it? I jettison the spear,  
The servantâ€™s try, the terrible drone of Chorus:  
*Yet to my thinking this act was ill advised  
It would have been better to die.*[^1] No it wouldnâ€™t!  
  
I am here to make you believe in life.  
  
[^1]: Chorus: from *Oedipus Rex*, trans. EF Watling
