<p>The moon was up, the Lake was shining clear<br>
Among the hoary<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> mountains; from the Shore<br>
I push'd, and struck the oars and struck again<br>
In cadence, and my little Boat mov'd on<br>
Even like a Man who walks with stately step<br>
Though bent on speed. It was an act of stealth<br>
And troubled pleasure; not without the voice<br>
Of mountain-echoes did my Boat move on,<br>
Leaving behind her still on either side<br>
Small circles glittering idly in the moon,<br>
Until they melted all into one track<br>
Of sparkling light. A rocky Steep uprose<br>
Above the Cavern of the Willow tree<br>
And now, as suited one who proudly row'd<br>
With his best skill, I fix'd a steady view<br>
Upon the top of that same craggy ridge,<br>
The bound of the horizon, for behind<br>
Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky.</p>
<p>She was an elfin Pinnace<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>; lustily<br>
I dipp'd my oars into the silent Lake,<br>
And, as I rose upon the stroke, my Boat<br>
Went heaving through the water, like a Swan;<br>
When from behind that craggy Steep, till then<br>
The bound of the horizon, a huge Cliff,<br>
As if with voluntary power instinct,<br>
Uprear'd its head. I struck, and struck again<br>
And, growing still in stature, the huge Cliff<br>
Rose up between me and the stars, and still,<br>
With measur'd motion, like a living thing,<br>
Strode after me. With trembling hands I turn'd,<br>
And through the silent water stole my way<br>
Back to the Cavern of the Willow tree.</p>
