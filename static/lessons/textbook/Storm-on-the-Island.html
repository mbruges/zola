<p>We are prepared: we build our houses squat,<br>
Sink walls in rock and roof them with good slate.<br>
The wizened earth had never troubled us<br>
With hay, so as you can see, there are no stacks<br>
Or stooks that can be lost. Nor are there trees<br>
Which might prove company when it blows full<br>
Blast: you know what I mean - leaves and branches<br>
Can raise a chorus in a gale<br>
So that you can listen to the thing you fear<br>
Forgetting that it pummels your house too.<br>
But there are no trees, no natural shelter.<br>
You might think that the sea is company,<br>
Exploding comfortably down on the cliffs<br>
But no: when it begins, the flung spray hits<br>
The very windows, spits like a tame cat<br>
Turned savage. We just sit tight while wind dives<br>
And strafes invisibly. Space is a salvo.<br>
We are bombarded by the empty air.<br>
Strange, it is a huge nothing that we fear</p>
