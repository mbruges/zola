It seemed an unlikely match. All winter unplugged,  
grinding its teeth in a plastic sleeve, the chainsaw swung  
nose-down from a hook in the darkroom  
under the hatch in the floor. When offered the can  
it knocked back a quarter-pint of engine oil  
and juices ran from its joints and threads,  
oozed across the guide-bar and the makerâ€™s name,  
into the dry links.  
  
From the summerhouse, still holding one last gulp  
of last yearâ€™s heat behind its double doors, and hung  
with the weightless wreckage of wasps and flies,  
moth-balled in spiderâ€™s woolâ€¦  
from there, I trailed the day-glo orange power-line  
the length of the lawn and the garden path,  
fed it out like powder from a keg, then walked  
back to the socket and flicked the switch, then walked again  
and coupled the saw to the flex â€“ clipped them together.  
Then dropped the safety catch and gunned the trigger.  
  
No gearing up or getting to speeds, just an instant rage,  
the rush of metal lashing out at air, connected to the main.  
The chainsaw with its perfect disregard, its mood  
to tangle with cloth, or jewellery, or hair.  
The chainsaw with its bloody desire, its sweet tooth  
for the flesh of the face and the bones underneath,  
its grand plan to kick back against nail or knot  
and rear up into the brain.  
I let it flare, lifted it into the sun  
and felt the hundred beats per second drumming in its heart,  
and felt the drive-wheel gargle in its throat.  
The pampas grass with its ludicrous feathers  
and plumes. The pampas grass, taking the warmth and light  
from cuttings and bulbs, sunning itself,  
stealing the show with its footstools, cushions and tufts  
and its twelve-foot spears.  
  
This was the sledgehammer taken to crack the nut.  
Probably all that was needed here was a good pull or shove  
or a pitchfork to lever it out at its base.  
Overkill. I touched the blur of the blade  
against the nearmost tip of a reed â€“ it didnâ€™t exist.  
I dabbed at a stalk that swooned, docked a couple of heads, dismissed the top third of its canes with a sideways sweep  
at shoulder height â€“ this was a game.  
I lifted the fringe of undergrowth, carved at the trunk â€“  
plant-juice spat from the pipes and tubes  
and dust flew out as I ripped into pockets of dark, secret  
warmth.  
  
To clear a space to work  
I raked whatever was severed or felled or torn  
towards the dead zone under the outhouse wall, to be fired.  
Then cut and raked, cut and raked, till what was left  
was a flat stump the size of a manhole cover or barrel lid  
that wouldnâ€™t be dug with a spade or prized from the earth. Wanting to finish things off I took up the saw  
and drove it vertically downwards into the upper roots,  
but the blade became choked with soil or fouled with weeds,  
or what was sliced or split somehow closed and mended  
behind, like cutting at water or air with a knife.  
I poured barbecue fluid into the patch  
and threw in a match â€“ it flamed for a minute, smoked for a minute more, and went  
out. I left it at that.  
In the weeks that came new shoots like asparagus tips  
sprang up from its nest and by June  
it was riding high in its saddle, wearing a new crown.  
Corn in Egypt. I looked on  
from the upstairs window like the midday moon.  
  
Back below stairs on its hook, the chainsaw seethed.  
I left it a year, to work back through its man-made dreams,  
to try to forget.  
The seamless urge to persist was as far as it got.
