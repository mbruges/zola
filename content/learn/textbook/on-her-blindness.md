My mother could not bear being blind,  
to be honest. One shouldn’t say it.  
  
One should hide the fact that catastrophic  
handicaps are hell; one tends to hear,  
  
publicly from those who bear it  
like a Roman, or somehow find joy  
  
in the fight. She turned to me, once,  
in a Paris restaurant, still not finding  
  
the food on the plate with her fork,  
or not so that it stayed on (try it  
  
in a pitch-black room) and whispered,  
“It’s living hell, to be honest Adam.  
  
If I gave up hope of a cure, I’d bump  
myself off.” I don’t recall what I replied,  
  
but it must have been the usual sop,  
inadequate: the locked-in son.  
  
She kept her dignity, though, even when  
bumping into walls like a dodgem; her sense  
of direction did not improve, when cast  
inward. “No built-in compass,” as my father  
  
joked. Instead, she pretended to  
ignore the void, or laughed it off.  
  
Or saw things she couldn’t see  
and smiled, as when the kids would offer  
  
the latest drawing, or show her their new toy  
– so we’d forget, at times, that the long,  
  
slow slide had finished in a vision  
as blank as stone. For instance, she’d continued  
  
to drive the old Lanchester  
long after it was safe  
  
down the Berkshire lanes. She’d visit exhibitions,  
admire films, sink into television  
  
while looking the wrong way.  
Her last week alive (a fortnight back)  
  
was golden weather, of course,  
the autumn trees around the hospital  
ablaze with colour, the ground royal  
with leaf-fall. I told her this, forgetting,  
  
as she sat too weak to move, staring  
at nothing. “Oh yes, I know,” she said,  
  
“it’s lovely out there.” Dying has made her  
no more sightless, but now she can’t  
  
pretend. Her eyelids were closed  
in the coffin; it was up to us to believe  
  
she was watching, somewhere, in the end.
