<p>I<br>
Half a league, half a league,<br>
Half a league onward,<br>
All in the valley of Death<br>
Rode the six hundred.<br>
‚ÄúForward, the Light Brigade!<br>
Charge for the guns!‚Äù he said.<br>
Into the valley of Death<br>
Rode the six hundred.</p>
<p>II<br>
‚ÄúForward, the Light Brigade!‚Äù<br>
Was there a man dismayed?<br>
Not though the soldier knew<br>
Someone had blundered.<br>
Theirs not to make reply,<br>
Theirs not to reason why,<br>
Theirs but to do and die.<br>
Into the valley of Death<br>
Rode the six hundred.</p>
<p>III<br>
Cannon to right of them,<br>
Cannon to left of them,<br>
Cannon in front of them<br>
Volleyed and thundered;<br>
Stormed at with shot and shell,<br>
Boldly they rode and well,<br>
Into the jaws of Death,<br>
Into the mouth of hell<br>
Rode the six hundred.</p>
<p>IV<br>
Flashed all their sabres bare,<br>
Flashed as they turned in air<br>
Sabring the gunners there,<br>
Charging an army, while<br>
All the world wondered.<br>
Plunged in the battery-smoke<br>
Right through the line they broke;<br>
Cossack and Russian<br>
Reeled from the sabre stroke<br>
Shattered and sundered.<br>
Then they rode back, but not<br>
Not the six hundred.</p>
<p>V<br>
Cannon to right of them,<br>
Cannon to left of them,<br>
Cannon behind them<br>
Volleyed and thundered;<br>
Stormed at with shot and shell,<br>
While horse and hero fell.<br>
They that had fought so well<br>
Came through the jaws of Death,<br>
Back from the mouth of hell,<br>
All that was left of them,<br>
Left of six hundred.</p>
<p>VI<br>
When can their glory fade?<br>
O the wild charge they made!<br>
All the world wondered.<br>
Honour the charge they made!<br>
Honour the Light Brigade,<br>
Noble six hundred!</p>
<p><em>by Lord Tennyson</em></p>
