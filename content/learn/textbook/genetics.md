My fatherâ€™s in my fingers, but my motherâ€™s in my palms.  
I lift them up and look at them with pleasure â€“  
I know my parents made me by my hands.  
  
They may have been repelled to separate lands,  
to separate hemispheres, may sleep with other lovers,  
but in me they touch where fingers link to palms.  
  
With nothing left of their togetherness but friends  
who quarry for their image by a river,  
at least I know their marriage by my hands.  
  
I shape a chapel where a steeple stands.  
And when I turn it over,  
my fatherâ€™s by my fingers, my motherâ€™s by my palms  
  
demure before a priest reciting psalms.  
My body is their marriage register.  
I re-enact their wedding with my hands.  
  
So take me with you, take up the skinâ€™s demands  
for mirroring in bodies of the future.  
Iâ€™ll bequeath my fingers, if you bequeath your palms.  
We know our parents make us by our hands.
