<h3 id="specimen-answer-1">Specimen answer 1</h3>
<p>The best way to test this claim is to do some primary research. The purpose is to find out about people's views on growing their own food. I would first do a survey of many people using a written questionnaire and ask open-ended questions to learn about their attitudes to gardening and growing food. The sample size would be very large, about 100 people, to ensure that the results were representative. Different groups would need to be included, like males and females and old and young. That way the data collected would reflect most people'.</p>
<p>To check the data collected from the survey was accurate, I would then do some interviews. This would also help me to understand the reasons why people enjoyed growing food. This should involve people who claim they like, and those who dislike, growing their own food to get a balanced understanding of different points of view. I would use questions about the amount of time people give to growing food and what types of plants, as well as the benefits and problems of growing food.</p>
<p>Finally, I would look at secondary data from research reports and experts in food production and gardening. Reports and statistics from government and university agricultural departments and gardening associations would be relevant to the topic. They would need to be recent and up to date to be accurate and reliable. Reports from experts in food production are important as they have experience and the ability to know about people's attitudes to growing food.</p>
<p>If the evidence from all these methods shows that the majority of people like growing food, then the claim could be verified as true.</p>
<h3 id="specimen-answer-2">Specimen answer 2</h3>
<p>I would start by undertaking secondary research to give me a better idea of the extent of the issue and what has been done so far by other researchers. I would look into the trend in the number of allotments that have been taken up in the city in recent years- if the number is rising, this could point towards more people using the facilities of the city to grow their own food. This information could be gathered from local council sources.</p>
<p>Once I have an idea of the general trend of increased popularity of growing your own food, I would conduct primary research to further help me test this. I would start by asking a random sample of people in my local area about growing their own food. The sample would have to be quite large to get meaningful results which I would then present visually to help show the extent of the interest. From the results, I would also use those people that do grow their own food to help me understand more about the motivations and reasons for this as well as how long they have been doing this for. This would use mini-interviews to be able to provide qualitative data about the issue which will help complement the quantitative data of the random sample short survey, as well as the secondary data which is likely to show more figures. This should result in a balanced test of the claim but may need to be repeated in different areas that I might not have access to.</p>

<h3 id="mark-scheme">Mark Scheme</h3>
<p><strong>Level 4 (7-8 marks)</strong> Very good response<br>
Clearly reasoned, credible and structured explanation of a range of ways to test the claim. The response contains three (or more) developed points, and may contain some undeveloped points.<br>
The response is clearly and explicitly related to testing the claim.</p>
<p><strong>Level 3 (5-6 marks)</strong> Good response<br>
Reasoned and mainly credible explanation of ways to test the claim. The response contains two (or more) developed points, and may contain some undeveloped points.</p>
<p><strong>Level 2 (3-4 marks)</strong> Reasonable response<br>
Some reasoning and explanation of ways to test the claim. The response contains one (or more) developed points), and/or a range of undeveloped points. The response may lack clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Level 1 (1-2 marks)</strong> Limited response<br>
Limited explanation of ways to test the claim. The response contains one or two simple, undeveloped and asserted points.<br>
There is little relevance in the response to testing the claim.</p>
