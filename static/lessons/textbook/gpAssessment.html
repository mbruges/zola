<h3>Source 2: Magazine Extract</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>International travel is rapidly changing and with this there will be consequences – economic, social and cultural. For example, technological change has enabled larger and more fuel-efficient ships to be built. As a result, the transportation of people by ship has increased. Improvements in technology are also taking place in other forms of international transport.
At the same time, people in many parts of the world are becoming richer and enjoying higher levels of education. In addition to this the media and the internet have increased awareness of other cultures and different environments. For example television documentaries about world wildlife are shown in many countries.
All of these reasons mean that people are more interested in international travel and holidays than in the past.</p>

<h3>International travel has benefits</h3>
<p>International travel has many benefits, including trade and tourism. We should celebrate the opportunities that international trade and tourism bring to everyone.
Trade between nations is increasing. The United Nations provides many statistics that prove this point. It now costs less to travel long distances than in the past. This brings new wealth and prosperity by providing employment to many people. Governments also have more income from taxes to spend on health and education.
Tourism is wonderful. We can have holidays in different countries and learn about other cultures. This encourages tolerance and respect for other perspectives and ways of life. I have seen this in my work as a manager in the tourist industry.</p>
