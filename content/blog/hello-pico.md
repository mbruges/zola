# Hello Pico.sh
*Trying new things, one CLI at a time.*

This is my *first* Pico.sh blog post, created and posted entirely from the ***terminal***.

```bash
echo " # Hello world! " >> hello-world.md
scp hello-world.md prose.sh:/
# Post published at 
# https://mxb.prose.sh/hello-world
```

## TO-DO:

- [x] ~~tweak CSS~~
- [x] fix footer
- [ ] write more
