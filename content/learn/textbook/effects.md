I held her hand, that was always scarred  
From chopping, slicing, from the knives that lay in wait  
In bowls of washing-up, that was raw,  
The knuckles reddened, rough from scrubbing hard  
At saucepan, frying pan, cup and plate  
And giving love the only way she knew,  
In each cheap cut of meat, in roast and stew,  
Old-fashioned food she cooked and we ate;  
And I saw that they had taken off her rings,  
The rings she kept once in her dressing-table drawer  
With faded snapshots, long-forgotten things  
(scent-sprays, tortoise-shell combs, a snap or two  
From the time we took a holiday “abroad”)  
But lately had never been without, as if  
She wanted everyone to know she was his wife  
Only now that he was dead.  
And her watch? – Classic ladies’ model, gold strap – it was gone,   
And I’d never known her not have that on,  
Not in all the years they sat together  
Watching soaps and game shows I’d disdain  
And not when my turn came to cook for her,  
Chops or chicken portions, English, bland,  
Familiar flavours she said she preferred  
To whatever “funny foreign stuff”  
Young people seemed to eat these days, she’d heard;  
Not all the weeks I didn’t come, when she sat  
Night after night and stared unseeing at  
The television, at her inner weather,  
Heaved herself upright, blinked and poured  
Drink after drink, and gulped and stared – the scotch  
That, when he was alive, she wouldn’t touch,  
That was her way to be with him again;  
Not later in the psychiatric ward,  
Where she blinked unseeing at the wall, the nurses  
(Who would steal anything, she said), and dreamt  
Of when she was a girl, of the time before  
I was born, or grew up and learned contempt,  
While the TV in the corner blared  
To drown some “poor soul’s” moans and curses,  
And she took her pills and blinked and stared  
As the others shuffled around, and drooled, and swore…  
But now she lay here, a thick rubber band  
With her name on it in smudged black ink was all she wore  
On the hand I held, a blotched and crinkled hand  
Whose fingers couldn’t clasp at mine any more  
Or falteringly wave, or fumble at my sleeve –  
The last words she had said were  
Please don’t leave  
But of course I left; now I was back, though she  
Could not know that, or turn her face to see  
A nurse bring the little bag of her effects to me.
