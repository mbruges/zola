Enter <span class="charname">Roderigo</span> and <span class="charname">Iago</span>.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">RODERIGO</span><br>
Tush, never tell me, I take it much unkindly<br>
That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse,<br>
As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">IAGO</span><br>
‚ÄôSblood, but you will not hear me.<br>
If ever I did dream of such a matter,<br>
Abhor me.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">RODERIGO</span><br>
Thou told‚Äôst me, thou didst hold him in thy hate.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">IAGO</span><br>
Despise me if I do not. Three great ones of the city,<br>
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,<br>
Off-capp‚Äôd to him; and by the faith of man,<br>
I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.<br>
But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,<br>
Evades them, with a bombast circumstance,<br>
Horribly stuff‚Äôd with epithets of war:<br>
And in conclusion,<br>
Nonsuits my mediators: for ‚ÄúCertes,‚Äù says he,<br>
‚ÄúI have already chose my officer.‚Äù<br>
And what was he?<br>
Forsooth, a great arithmetician,<br>
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,<br>
A fellow almost damn‚Äôd in a fair wife,<br>
That never set a squadron in the field,<br>
Nor the division of a battle knows<br>
More than a spinster, unless the bookish theoric,<br>
Wherein the toged consuls can propose<br>
As masterly as he: mere prattle without practice<br>
Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election,<br>
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof<br>
At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds,<br>
Christian and heathen, must be belee‚Äôd and calm‚Äôd<br>
By debitor and creditor, this counter-caster,<br>
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,<br>
And I, God bless the mark, his Moorship‚Äôs ancient.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">RODERIGO</span><br>
By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">IAGO</span><br>
Why, there‚Äôs no remedy. ‚ÄôTis the curse of service,<br>
Preferment goes by letter and affection,<br>
And not by old gradation, where each second<br>
Stood heir to the first. Now sir, be judge yourself<br>
Whether I in any just term am affin‚Äôd<br>
To love the Moor.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">RODERIGO</span><br>
I would not follow him, then.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">IAGO</span><br>
O, sir, content you.<br>
I follow him to serve my turn upon him:<br>
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters<br>
Cannot be truly follow‚Äôd. You shall mark<br>
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave<br>
That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,<br>
Wears out his time, much like his master‚Äôs ass,<br>
For nought but provender, and when he‚Äôs old, cashier‚Äôd.<br>
Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are<br>
Who, trimm‚Äôd in forms, and visages of duty,<br>
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,<br>
And throwing but shows of service on their lords,<br>
Do well thrive by them, and when they have lin‚Äôd their coats,<br>
Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,<br>
And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,<br>
It is as sure as you are Roderigo,<br>
Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:<br>
In following him, I follow but myself.<br>
Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,<br>
But seeming so for my peculiar end.<br>
For when my outward action doth demonstrate<br>
The native act and figure of my heart<br>
In complement extern, ‚Äôtis not long after<br>
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve<br>
For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">RODERIGO</span><br>
What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe,<br>
If he can carry‚Äôt thus!
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">IAGO</span><br>
Call up her father,<br>
Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight,<br>
Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,<br>
And though he in a fertile climate dwell,<br>
Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,<br>
Yet throw such changes of vexation on‚Äôt,<br>
As it may lose some color.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">RODERIGO</span><br>
Here is her father‚Äôs house, I‚Äôll call aloud.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">IAGO</span><br>

As when, by night and negligence, the fire<br>
Is spied in populous cities.

<span class="char-name">IAGO</span><br>
Zounds, sir, you‚Äôre robb‚Äôd, for shame put on your gown,<br>
Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;<br>
Even now, now, very now, an old black ram<br>
Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise,<br>
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,<br>
Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:<br>
Arise, I say.

<span class="char-name">BRABANTIO</span><br>
Not I. What are you?
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">RODERIGO</span><br>
My name is Roderigo.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">BRABANTIO</span><br>
The worser welcome.<br>
I have charg‚Äôd thee not to haunt about my doors;<br>
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say<br>
My daughter is not for thee; and now in madness,<br>
Being full of supper and distempering draughts,<br>
Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come<br>
To start my quiet.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">RODERIGO</span><br>
Sir, sir, sir,‚Äî
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">BRABANTIO</span><br>
But thou must needs be sure<br>
My spirit and my place have in them power<br>
To make this bitter to thee.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">RODERIGO</span><br>
Patience, good sir.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">BRABANTIO</span><br>
What tell‚Äôst thou me of robbing?<br>
This is Venice. My house is not a grange.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">RODERIGO</span><br>
Most grave Brabantio,<br>
In simple and pure soul I come to you.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">IAGO</span><br>
Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil bid you.
Because we come to do you service, and you think we are ruffians, you‚Äôll have
your daughter cover‚Äôd with a Barbary horse; you‚Äôll have your nephews neigh to
you; you‚Äôll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">BRABANTIO</span><br>
What profane wretch art thou?
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">IAGO</span><br>
I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making
the beast with two backs.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">BRABANTIO</span><br>
Thou art a villain.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">IAGO</span><br>
You are a senator.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">BRABANTIO</span><br>
This thou shalt answer. I know thee, Roderigo.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">RODERIGO</span><br>
Sir, I will answer anything. But I beseech you,<br>
If ‚Äôt be your pleasure, and most wise consent,<br>
(As partly I find it is) that your fair daughter,<br>
At this odd-even and dull watch o‚Äô the night,<br>
Transported with no worse nor better guard,<br>
But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,<br>
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor:<br>
If this be known to you, and your allowance,<br>
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs.<br>
But if you know not this, my manners tell me,<br>
We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe<br>
That from the sense of all civility,<br>
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence.<br>
Your daughter (if you have not given her leave)<br>
I say again, hath made a gross revolt,<br>
Tying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes<br>
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger<br>
Of here and everywhere. Straight satisfy yourself:<br>
If she be in her chamber or your house,<br>
Let loose on me the justice of the state<br>
For thus deluding you.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">BRABANTIO</span><br>
Strike on the tinder, ho!<br>
Give me a taper! Call up all my people!<br>
This accident is not unlike my dream,<br>
Belief of it oppresses me already.<br>
Light, I say, light!
</p>

[<i>Exit from above.</i>]
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">IAGO</span><br>
Farewell; for I must leave you:<br>
It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place<br>
To be produc‚Äôd, as if I stay I shall,<br>
Against the Moor. For I do know the state,<br>
However this may gall him with some check,<br>
Cannot with safety cast him, for he‚Äôs embark‚Äôd<br>
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,<br>
Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,<br>
Another of his fathom they have none<br>
To lead their business. In which regard,<br>
Though I do hate him as I do hell pains,<br>
Yet, for necessity of present life,<br>
I must show out a flag and sign of love,<br>
Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,<br>
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search,<br>
And there will I be with him. So, farewell.

It is too true an evil. Gone she is,<br>
And what‚Äôs to come of my despised time,<br>
Is naught but bitterness. Now Roderigo,<br>
Where didst thou see her? (O unhappy girl!)<br>
With the Moor, say‚Äôst thou? (Who would be a father!)<br>
How didst thou know ‚Äôtwas she? (O, she deceives me<br>
Past thought.) What said she to you? Get more tapers,<br>
Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?

<span class="char-name">BRABANTIO</span><br>
O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!<br>
Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters‚Äô minds<br>
By what you see them act. Is there not charms<br>
By which the property of youth and maidhood<br>
May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,<br>
Of some such thing?

<span class="char-name">RODERIGO</span><br>
Yes, sir, I have indeed.

Some one way, some another. Do you know<br>
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?

I think I can discover him, if you please<br>
To get good guard, and go along with me.

Pray you lead on. At every house I‚Äôll call,<br>

On, good Roderigo. I will deserve your pains.

Her father lov‚Äôd me, oft invited me,<br>
Still question‚Äôd me the story of my life,<br>
From year to year‚Äîthe battles, sieges, fortunes,<br>
That I have pass‚Äôd.<br>
I ran it through, even from my boyish days<br>
To the very moment that he bade me tell it,<br>
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,<br>
Of moving accidents by flood and field;<br>
Of hair-breadth scapes i‚Äô th‚Äô imminent deadly breach;<br>
Of being taken by the insolent foe,<br>

She‚Äôd come again, and with a greedy ear<br>
Devour up my discourse; which I observing,<br>
Took once a pliant hour, and found good means<br>
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart<br>
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,<br>
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,<br>
But not intentively. I did consent,<br>
And often did beguile her of her tears,<br>
When I did speak of some distressful stroke<br>
That my youth suffer‚Äôd. My story being done,<br>
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs.<br>
She swore, in faith, ‚Äôtwas strange, ‚Äôtwas passing strange;<br>
‚ÄôTwas pitiful, ‚Äôtwas wondrous pitiful.<br>
She wish‚Äôd she had not heard it, yet she wish‚Äôd<br>
That heaven had made her such a man: she thank‚Äôd me,<br>

I should but teach him how to tell my story,<br>
And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:<br>
She lov‚Äôd me for the dangers I had pass‚Äôd,<br>

Virtue! a fig! ‚ÄôTis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies are
gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners. So that if we will plant nettles
or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of
herbs or distract it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or
manured with industry, why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in
our wills. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise
another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us
to most preposterous conclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging
motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this, that you
call love, to be a sect, or scion.

<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">RODERIGO</span><br>

It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will. Come, be a man.
Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy friend,
and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness; I
could never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse; follow thou the
wars; defeat thy favour with an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse.
It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moor,‚Äîput
money in thy purse,‚Äînor he his to her. It was a violent commencement, and thou
shalt see an answerable sequestration‚Äîput but money in thy purse. These Moors
are changeable in their wills. Fill thy purse with money. The food that to him
now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as acerb as the
coloquintida. She must change for youth. When she is sated with his body, she
will find the error of her choice. She must have change, she must. Therefore
put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate
way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow

Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what violence
she first loved the Moor, but for bragging, and telling her fantastical lies.
And will she love him still for prating? Let not thy discreet heart think it.
Her eye must be fed. And what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When
the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be, again to inflame
it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour, sympathy in
years, manners, and beauties; all which the Moor is defective in: now, for want
of these required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself
abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor, very nature
will instruct her in it, and compel her to some second choice. Now sir, this
granted (as it is a most pregnant and unforced position) who stands so
eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? a knave very voluble;
no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane
seeming, for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection?
Why, none, why, none! A slipper and subtle knave, a finder out of occasions;
that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage
never present itself: a devilish knave! Besides, the knave is handsome, young,
and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after. A

Watch you tonight. For the command, I‚Äôll lay‚Äôt upon you. Cassio knows you not.

That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;<br>
That she loves him, ‚Äôtis apt, and of great credit:<br>
The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,<br>
Is of a constant, loving, noble nature;<br>
And, I dare think, he‚Äôll prove to Desdemona<br>
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,<br>
Not out of absolute lust (though peradventure<br>
I stand accountant for as great a sin)<br>
But partly led to diet my revenge,<br>
For that I do suspect the lusty Moor<br>
Hath leap‚Äôd into my seat. The thought whereof<br>
Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards,<br>
And nothing can or shall content my soul<br>
Till I am even‚Äôd with him, wife for wife,<br>
Or, failing so, yet that I put the Moor<br>
At least into a jealousy so strong<br>
That judgement cannot cure. Which thing to do,<br>
If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash<br>
For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,<br>
I‚Äôll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,<br>
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb<br>
(For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too)<br>
Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me<br>

And practicing upon his peace and quiet<br>
Even to madness. ‚ÄôTis here, but yet confus‚Äôd.<br>

To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,<br>
Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;<br>
Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:<br>
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw<br>
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,<br>
For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,<br>

Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure.<br>
I would not have your free and noble nature,<br>
Out of self-bounty, be abus‚Äôd. Look to‚Äôt.<br>

Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

The world‚Äôs a huge thing. It is a great price<br>
For a small vice.

In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">EMILIA</span><br>
In troth, I think I should, and undo‚Äôt when I had done. Marry, I would not do
such a thing for a joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for gowns,
petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition; but, for the whole world‚Äîwhy,
who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch? I should
venture purgatory for ‚Äôt.

Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong for the whole world.
</p>

Why, the wrong is but a wrong i‚Äô the world; and having the world for your

</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">DESDEMONA</span><br>
I do not think there is any such woman.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">EMILIA</span><br>
Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played
for.<br>
But I do think it is their husbands‚Äô faults<br>
If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,<br>
And pour our treasures into foreign laps;<br>
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,<br>
Throwing restraint upon us. Or say they strike us,<br>
Or scant our former having in despite.<br>
Why, we have galls; and though we have some grace,<br>
Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know<br>
Their wives have sense like them: they see, and smell<br>
And have their palates both for sweet and sour,<br>
As husbands have. What is it that they do<br>
When they change us for others? Is it sport?<br>
I think it is. And doth affection breed it?<br>
I think it doth. Is‚Äôt frailty that thus errs?<br>
It is so too. And have not we affections,<br>
Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?<br>
Then let them use us well: else let them know,<br>
The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.
</p>
<p class="drama">

Good night, good night. Heaven me such usage send,<br>
Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!

Sir, you shall understand what hath befall‚Äôn,<br>
Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter<br>
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,<br>
And here another. The one of them imports<br>
The death of Cassio, to be undertook<br>
By Roderigo.

<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">OTHELLO</span><br>
O villain!

Now here‚Äôs another discontented paper,<br>
Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,<br>
Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain,<br>
But that, belike, Iago in the interim<br>
Came in and satisfied him.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">OTHELLO</span><br>
O the pernicious caitiff!<br>
How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief<br>
That was my wife‚Äôs?
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">CASSIO</span><br>
I found it in my chamber.<br>
And he himself confess‚Äôd but even now,<br>
That there he dropp‚Äôd it for a special purpose<br>
Which wrought to his desire.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">OTHELLO</span><br>
O fool! fool! fool!
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">CASSIO</span><br>
There is besides in Roderigo‚Äôs letter,<br>
How he upbraids Iago, that he made him<br>
Brave me upon the watch, whereon it came<br>
That I was cast. And even but now he spake,<br>
After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,<br>
Iago set him on.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">LODOVICO</span><br>
You must forsake this room, and go with us.<br>
Your power and your command is taken off,<br>
And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,<br>
If there be any cunning cruelty<br>
That can torment him much and hold him long,<br>
It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,<br>
Till that the nature of your fault be known<br>
To the Venetian state. Come, bring away.
</p>
<p class="drama">
<span class="char-name">OTHELLO</span><br>
Soft you; a word or two before you go.<br>
I have done the state some service, and they know‚Äôt.<br>
No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,<br>
When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,<br>
Speak of me as I am. Nothing extenuate,<br>
Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak<br>
Of one that loved not wisely, but too well;<br>
Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought,<br>
Perplex‚Äôd in the extreme; of one whose hand,<br>
Like the base Judean, threw a pearl away<br>
Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdu‚Äôd eyes,<br>
Albeit unused to the melting mood,<br>
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees<br>
Their medicinal gum. Set you down this.<br>
And say besides, that in Aleppo once,<br>
Where a malignant and a turban‚Äôd Turk<br>
Beat a Venetian and traduc‚Äôd the state,<br>
I took by the throat the circumcised dog,<br>
And smote him, thus.
