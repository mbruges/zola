Once she is halfway up there, crouched in her bikini  
on the porch roof of her family's house, trembling,  
she knows that the one thing she must not do is to think  
of the narrow windowsill, the sharp  
drop of the stairwell; she must keep her mind  
on the friend with whom she is half in love  
and who is waiting for her on the blond  
gravel somewhere beneath her, keep her mind  
on her and on the fact of the open window  
the flimsy, hole-punched, aluminium lever  
towards which in a moment she will reach  
with the length of her whole body, leaning in  
to the warm flank of the house. But first she  
steadies herself, still crouching, the grains of the asphalt  
hot beneath her toes and fingertips,  
a square of petrified beach. Her tiny breasts  
rest lightly on her thighs. â€“ What can she know  
of the way the world admits us less and less  
the more we grow? For now both girls seem  
lit, as if from within, their hair and the gold stud  
earrings in the first one's ears; for now the long, grey  
eye of the street, and far away from the mother  
who does not trust her daughter with a key,  
the workers about their business in the drab  
electroplating factory over the road,  
far too, most far, from the flush-faced secretary  
who, with her head full of the evening class  
she plans to take, or the trip of a lifetime, looks up now  
from the stirring omens of the astrology column  
at a girl â€“ thirteen if she's a day â€“ standing  
in next to nothing in the driveway opposite,  
one hand flat against her stomach, one  
shielding her eyes to gaze up at a pale calf,  
a silver anklet and the five neat shimmering-  
oyster-painted toenails of an outstretched foot  
which catch the sunlight briefly like the  
flash of armaments before  
dropping gracefully into the shade of the house.
