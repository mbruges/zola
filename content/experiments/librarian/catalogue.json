Since his mother's mysterious death, he's lived alone on the streets of Boston, surviving by his wits, keeping one step ahead of the police and the truant officers. One day, he's tracked down by an uncle he barely knows-a man his mother claimed was dangerous. Uncle Randolph tells him an impossible secret: Magnus is the son of a Norse god. The Viking myths are true. The gods of Asgard are preparing for war. Trolls, giants and worse monsters are stirring for doomsday. To prevent Ragnarok, Magnus must search the Nine Worlds for a weapon that has been lost for thousands of years. When an attack by fire giants forces him to choose between his own safety and the lives of hundreds of innocents, Magnus makes a fatal decision.

From his glorious urban skyscapes to the tender portrayal of a falling feather or the tying of a shoelace or a dog's joy in scratching his back, Bob lets us in on a world view conveyed with humanity, compassion and affection.

She's alone--left behind in a town that has been mysteriously evacuated and abandoned. With no one to rely on, no power, and no working phone lines or internet access, Maddie slowly learns to survive on her own. Her only companions are a Rottweiler named George and all the books she can read. After a rough start, Maddie learns to trust her own ingenuity and invents clever ways to survive in a place that has been deserted and forgotten. As months pass, she escapes natural disasters, looters, and wild animals.

But when she walks into a Dallas art studio in search of a job, she doesn't expect to find a deep attraction to the enigmatic artist who works there, Owen Gentry. For once, Auburn takes a chance and puts her heart in control, only to discover that Owen is keeping a major secret from coming out. The magnitude of his past threatens to destroy everything important to Auburn, and the only way to get her life back on track is to cut Owen out of it. To save their relationship, all Owen needs to do is confess. But in this case, the confession could be much more destructive than the actual sin.\"--Publisher."],"ind1":" ","ind2":" "}],"521":[{"a":["Adult"],"b":["Follett School Solutions."],"ind1":"2","ind2":" "}],"650":[{"a":["Artists' studios"],"ind1":" ","ind2":"0","v":["Fiction."],"z":["Texas","Dallas"]},{"a":["Man-woman relationships"],"ind1":" ","ind2":"0","v":["Fiction."]},{"a":["Artists"],"ind1":" ","ind2":"0","v":["Fiction."]},{"a":["Confession"],"ind1":" ","ind2":"0","v":["Fiction."]}],"651":[{"a":["Dallas (Tex.)"],"ind1":" ","ind2":"0","v":["Fiction."]}],"655":[{"2":["lcgft"],"a":["Romance fiction."],"ind1":" ","ind2":"7"}],"852":[{"9":["15.86USD"],"a":["Prep"],"h":["HOO H"],"ind1":" ","ind2":" ","p":["3P2001431"],"x":["COPYID:21276","FSC@astory sacks@c20230607"]}],"900":[{"a":["HOO H"],"ind1":" ","ind2":" "}],"940":[{"b":["Adult"],"d":["06/07/23"],"ind1":" ","ind2":" ","v":["FSS"]}]}},

Ever since the Great Rust, a catastrophic event that blighted the arcane force called the Dynamism and threw America into disarray, the country has been rebuilding for a better future. And everyone knows the future is industry and technology--otherwise known as Mechomancy--not the traditional mystical arts. Laura disagrees. A talented young mage from Pennsylvania, Laura hopped a portal to New York City on her seventeenth birthday with hopes of earning her mage's license and becoming something more than a rootworker. But six months later, she's got little to show for it other than an empty pocket and broken dreams. With nowhere else to turn, Laura applies for a job with the Bureau of the Arcane's Conservation Corps, a branch of the US government dedicated to repairing the Dynamism so that Mechomancy can thrive. There she meets the Skylark, a powerful mage with a mysterious past, who reluctantly takes Laura on as an apprentice. As they're sent off on their first mission together into the heart of the country's oldest and most mysterious Blight, they discover the work of mages not encountered since the darkest period in America's past, when Black mages were killed for their power--work that could threaten Laura's and the Skylark's lives, and everything they've worked for\"--Provided by publisher."],"ind1":" ","ind2":" "}],"521":[{"a":["Young Adult"],"b":["Follett School Solutions."],"ind1":"2","ind2":" "}],"650":[{"a":["Magic"],"ind1":" ","ind2":"0","v":["Juvenile fiction."]},{"a":["African Americans"],"ind1":" ","ind2":"0","v":["Juvenile fiction."]},{"a":["Racism"],"ind1":" ","ind2":"0","v":["Juvenile fiction."]},{"a":["Conspiracies"],"ind1":" ","ind2":"0","v":["Juvenile fiction."]},{"a":["Magic"],"ind1":" ","ind2":"1","v":["Fiction."]},{"a":["African Americans"],"ind1":" ","ind2":"1","v":["Fiction."]},{"a":["Racism"],"ind1":" ","ind2":"1","v":["Fiction."]},{"a":["Conspiracies"],"ind1":" ","ind2":"1","v":["Fiction."]},{"a":["Fantasy."],"ind1":" ","ind2":"1"}],"655":[{"2":["lcgft"],"a":["Fantasy fiction."],"ind1":" ","ind2":"7"}],"852":[{"9":["17.62USD"],"a":["Prep"],"h":["IRE I"],"ind1":" ","ind2":" ","p":["3P2001552"],"x":["COPYID:21392","FSC@astory sacks@c20230607"]}],"900":[{"a":["IRE I"],"ind1":" ","ind2":" "}],"940":[{"b":["Young Adult"],"d":["06/07/23"],"ind1":" ","ind2":" ","s":["School Library Journal starred, October 2022","Booklist starred, September 2022","Pub Weekly, August 2022"],"v":["FSS"]}]}},

Two years have passed since the events that no one wants to think about. Everyone has tried to move on, but there's something about this place that prevents it. The destruction caused by a ferocious late-summer storm reignites the old rivalry between Beartown and the neighboring town of Hed, a rivalry which has always been fought through their ice hockey teams. Maya's parents, Peter and Kira, are caught up in an investigation of the hockey club's murky finances, and Amat--once the star of the Beartown team--has lost his way after an injury and a failed attempt to get drafted into the NHL. Simmering tensions between the two towns turn into acts of intimidation and then violence. All the while, a fourteen-year-old boy grows increasingly alienated from this hockey-obsessed community and is determined to take revenge on the people he holds responsible for his beloved sister's death. He has a pistol and a plan that will leave Beartown with a loss that is almost more that it can stand\"--Provided by publisher."],"ind1":" ","ind2":" "}],"521":[{"a":["Adult"],"b":["Follett School Solutions."],"ind1":"2","ind2":" "}],"650":[{"a":["Hockey"],"ind1":" ","ind2":"0","v":["Fiction."],"z":["Sweden"]},{"a":["Small cities"],"ind1":" ","ind2":"0","v":["Fiction."]},{"a":["Storms"],"ind1":" ","ind2":"0","v":["Fiction."]},{"a":["Corruption"],"ind1":" ","ind2":"0","v":["Fiction."]},{"a":["Revenge"],"ind1":" ","ind2":"0","v":["Fiction."]},{"a":["Hockey stories."],"ind1":" ","ind2":"0"}],"651":[{"a":["Sweden"],"ind1":" ","ind2":"0","v":["Fiction."]}],"655":[{"2":["lcgft"],"a":["Sports fiction."],"ind1":" ","ind2":"7"}],"700":[{"a":["Smith, Neil"],"e":["tr."],"ind1":"1","ind2":" ","q":["(Neil Andrew),"]}],"852":[{"9":["26.42USD"],"a":["Prep"],"h":["BAC B"],"ind1":" ","ind2":" ","p":["3P2001603"],"x":["COPYID:21443","FSC@astory sacks@c20230607"]}],"900":[{"a":["BAC B"],"ind1":" ","ind2":" "}],"940":[{"b":["Adult"],"d":["06/07/23"],"ind1":" ","ind2":" ","s":["Booklist starred, September 2022","New York Times, October 2022","Library Journal web only, October 2022"],"v":["FSS"]}]}},
