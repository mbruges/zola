<p class="noindent"><span class="counter" id="p1">p1</span><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">A</span> few</span> miles south of Soledad, the Salinas River
drops in close to the hillside bank and runs deep and
green. The water is warm too, for it has slipped twinkling
over the yellow sands in the sunlight before reaching
the narrow pool. On one side of the river the
golden foothill slopes curve up to the strong and rocky
Gabilan mountains, but on the valley side the water is
lined with trees—willows fresh and green with every
spring, carrying in their lower leaf junctures the debris
of the winter’s flooding; and sycamores with mottled,
white, recumbent limbs and branches that arch over
the pool. On the sandy bank under the trees the leaves
lie deep and so crisp that a lizard makes a great skittering
if he runs among them. Rabbits come out of the
brush to sit on the sand in the evening, and the damp
flats are covered with the night tracks of ’coons, and
with the spread pads of dogs from the ranches, and
with the split-wedge tracks of deer that come to drink
in the dark.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p2">p2</span>There is a path through the willows and among the
sycamores, a path beaten hard by boys coming down
from the ranches to swim in the deep pool, and beaten
hard by tramps who come wearily down from the
highway in the evening to jungle-up near water. In
front of the low horizontal limb of a giant sycamore
there is an ash pile made by many fires; the limb is
worn smooth by men who have sat on it.</p>

<hr class="tbk">

<p><span class="counter" id="p3">p3</span>Evening of a hot day started the little wind to moving
among the leaves. The shade climbed up the hills
toward the top. On the sand banks the rabbits sat as
quietly as little gray, sculptured stones. And then from
the direction of the state highway came the sound of
footsteps on crisp sycamore leaves. The rabbits hurried
noiselessly for cover. A stilted heron labored up into
the air and pounded down river. For a moment the
place was lifeless, and then two men emerged from
the path and came into the opening by the green pool.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p4">p4</span>They had walked in single file down the path, and
even in the open one stayed behind the other. Both
were dressed in denim trousers and in denim coats with
brass buttons. Both wore black, shapeless hats and both
carried tight blanket rolls slung over their shoulders.
The first man was small and quick, dark of face, with
restless eyes and sharp, strong features. Every part of
him was defined: small, strong hands, slender arms, a
thin and bony nose. Behind him walked his opposite,
a huge man, shapeless of face, with large, pale eyes,
with wide, sloping shoulders; and he walked heavily,
dragging his feet a little, the way a bear drags his paws.
His arms did not swing at his sides, but hung loosely.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p5">p5</span>The first man stopped short in the clearing, and the
follower nearly ran over him. He took off his hat and
wiped the sweat-band with his forefinger and snapped
the moisture off. His huge companion dropped his
blankets and flung himself down and drank from the
surface of the green pool; drank with long gulps,
snorting into the water like a horse. The small man
stepped nervously beside him.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p6">p6</span>“Lennie!” he said sharply. “Lennie, for God’ sakes
don’t drink so much.” Lennie continued to snort into
the pool. The small man leaned over and shook him by
the shoulder. “Lennie. You gonna be sick like you was
last night.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p7">p7</span>Lennie dipped his whole head under, hat and all,
and then he sat up on the bank and his hat dripped
down on his blue coat and ran down his back. “Tha’s
good,” he said. “You drink some, George. You take a
good big drink.” He smiled happily.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p8">p8</span>George unslung his bindle and dropped it gently on
the bank. “I ain’t sure it’s good water,” he said. “Looks
kinda scummy.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p9">p9</span>Lennie dabbled his big paw in the water and wiggled
his fingers so the water arose in little splashes; rings
widened across the pool to the other side and came
back again. Lennie watched them go. “Look, George.
Look what I done.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p10">p10</span>George knelt beside the pool and drank from his
hand with quick scoops. “Tastes all right,” he admitted.
“Don’t really seem to be running, though. You never
oughta drink water when it ain’t running, Lennie,” he
said hopelessly. “You’d drink out of a gutter if you
was thirsty.” He threw a scoop of water into his face
and rubbed it about with his hand, under his chin and
around the back of his neck. Then he replaced his hat,
pushed himself back from the river, drew up his knees
and embraced them. Lennie, who had been watching,
imitated George exactly. He pushed himself back,
drew up his knees, embraced them, looked over to
George to see whether he had it just right. He pulled
his hat down a little more over his eyes, the way
George’s hat was.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p11">p11</span>George stared morosely at the water. The rims of
his eyes were red with sun glare. He said angrily, “We
could just as well of rode clear to the ranch if that
bastard bus driver knew what he was talkin’ about.
‘Jes’ a little stretch down the highway,’ he says. ‘Jes’ a
little stretch.’ God damn near four miles, that’s what
it was! Didn’t wanta stop at the ranch gate, that’s
what. Too God damn lazy to pull up. Wonder he
isn’t too damn good to stop in Soledad at all. Kicks us
out and says, ‘Jes’ a little stretch down the road.’ I bet
it was <span class="it">more</span> than four miles. Damn hot day.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p12">p12</span>Lennie looked timidly over to him. “George?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p13">p13</span>“Yeah, what ya want?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p14">p14</span>“Where we goin’, George?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p15">p15</span>The little man jerked down the brim of his hat and
scowled over at Lennie. “So you forgot that awready,
did you? I gotta tell you again, do I? Jesus Christ,
you’re a crazy bastard!”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p16">p16</span>“I forgot,” Lennie said softly. “I tried not to forget.
Honest to God I did, George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p17">p17</span>“O.K.—O.K. I’ll tell ya again. I ain’t got nothing
to do. Might jus’ as well spen’ all my time tellin’ you
things and then you forget ’em, and I tell you again.”
“Tried and tried,” said Lennie, “but it didn’t do no
good. I remember about the rabbits, George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p18">p18</span>“The hell with the rabbits. That’s all you ever can
remember is them rabbits. O.K.! Now you listen and
this time you got to remember so we don’t get in no
trouble. You remember settin’ in that gutter on
Howard street and watchin’ that blackboard?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p19">p19</span>Lennie’s face broke into a delighted smile. “Why
sure, George, I remember that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what’d we
do then? I remember some girls come by and you says
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you say .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p20">p20</span>“The hell with what I says. You remember about us
goin’ into Murray and Ready’s, and they give us work
cards and bus tickets?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p21">p21</span>“Oh, sure, George. I remember that now.” His
hands went quickly into his side coat pockets. He said
gently, “George .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I ain’t got mine. I musta lost it.”
He looked down at the ground in despair.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p22">p22</span>“You never had none, you crazy bastard. I got both
of ’em here. Think I’d let you carry your own work
card?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p23">p23</span>Lennie grinned with relief. “I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I thought I put it
in my side pocket.” His hand went into the pocket
again.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p24">p24</span>George looked sharply at him. “What’d you take
outa that pocket?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p25">p25</span>“Ain’t a thing in my pocket,” Lennie said cleverly.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p26">p26</span>“I know there ain’t. You got it in your hand. What
you got in your hand—hidin’ it?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p27">p27</span>“I ain’t got nothin’, George. Honest.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p28">p28</span>“Come on, give it here.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p29">p29</span>Lennie held his closed hand away from George’s
direction. “It’s on’y a mouse, George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p30">p30</span>“A mouse? A live mouse?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p31">p31</span>“Uh-uh. Jus’ a dead mouse, George. I didn’ kill it.
Honest! I found it. I found it dead.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p32">p32</span>“Give it here!” said George.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p33">p33</span>“Aw, leave me have it, George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p34">p34</span>“<span class="it">Give it here!</span>”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p35">p35</span>Lennie’s closed hand slowly obeyed. George took
the mouse and threw it across the pool to the other
side, among the brush. “What you want of a dead
mouse, anyways?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p36">p36</span>“I could pet it with my thumb while we walked
along,” said Lennie.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p37">p37</span>“Well, you ain’t petting no mice while you walk
with me. You remember where we’re goin’ now?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p38">p38</span>Lennie looked startled and then in embarrassment
hid his face against his knees. “I forgot again.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p39">p39</span>“Jesus Christ,” George said resignedly. “Well—look,
we’re gonna work on a ranch like the one we
come from up north.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p40">p40</span>“Up north?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p41">p41</span>“In Weed.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p42">p42</span>“Oh, sure. I remember. In Weed.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p43">p43</span>“That ranch we’re goin’ to is right down there
about a quarter mile. We’re gonna go in an’ see the
boss. Now, look—I’ll give him the work tickets, but
you ain’t gonna say a word. You jus’ stand there and
don’t say nothing. If he finds out what a crazy bastard
you are, we won’t get no job, but if he sees ya work
before he hears ya talk, we’re set. Ya got that?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p44">p44</span>“Sure, George. Sure I got it.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p45">p45</span>“O.K. Now when we go in to see the boss, what
you gonna do?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p46">p46</span>“I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I,” Lennie thought. His face grew tight with
thought. “I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ain’t gonna say nothin’. Jus’ gonna
stan’ there.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p47">p47</span>“Good boy. That’s swell. You say that over two,
three times so you sure won’t forget it.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p48">p48</span>Lennie droned to himself softly, “I ain’t gonna say
nothin’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I ain’t gonna say nothin’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I ain’t gonna
say nothin’.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p49">p49</span>“O.K.,” said George. “An’ you ain’t gonna do no
bad things like you done in Weed, neither.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p50">p50</span>Lennie looked puzzled. “Like I done in Weed?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p51">p51</span>“Oh, so ya forgot that too, did ya? Well, I ain’t
gonna remind ya, fear ya do it again.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p52">p52</span>A light of understanding broke on Lennie’s face.
“They run us outa Weed,” he exploded triumphantly.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p53">p53</span>“Run us out, hell,” said George disgustedly. “We
run. They was lookin’ for us, but they didn’t catch
us.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p54">p54</span>Lennie giggled happily. “I didn’t forget that, you
bet.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p55">p55</span>George lay back on the sand and crossed his hands
under his head, and Lennie imitated him, raising his
head to see whether he were doing it right. “God,
you’re a lot of trouble,” said George. “I could get
along so easy and so nice if I didn’t have you on my
tail. I could live so easy and maybe have a girl.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p56">p56</span>For a moment Lennie lay quiet, and then he said
hopefully, “We gonna work on a ranch, George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p57">p57</span>“Awright. You got that. But we’re gonna sleep here
because I got a reason.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p58">p58</span>The day was going fast now. Only the tops of the
Gabilan mountains flamed with the light of the sun
that had gone from the valley. A water snake slipped
along on the pool, its head held up like a little periscope.
The reeds jerked slightly in the current. Far
off toward the highway a man shouted something, and
another man shouted back. The sycamore limbs rustled
under a little wind that died immediately.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p59">p59</span>“George—why ain’t we goin’ on to the ranch and
get some supper? They got supper at the ranch.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p60">p60</span>George rolled on his side. “No reason at all for you.
I like it here. Tomorra we’re gonna go to work. I seen
thrashin’ machines on the way down. That means we’ll
be bucking grain bags, bustin’ a gut. Tonight I’m
gonna lay right here and look up. I like it.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p61">p61</span>Lennie got up on his knees and looked down at
George. “Ain’t we gonna have no supper?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p62">p62</span>“Sure we are, if you gather up some dead willow
sticks. I got three can of beans in my bindle. You get
a fire ready. I’ll give you a match when you get the
sticks together. Then we’ll heat the beans and have
supper.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p63">p63</span>Lennie said, “I like beans with ketchup.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p64">p64</span>“Well, we ain’t got no ketchup. You go get wood.
An’ don’t you fool around. It’ll be dark before long.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p65">p65</span>Lennie lumbered to his feet and disappeared in the
brush. George lay where he was and whistled softly
to himself. There were sounds of splashings down the
river in the direction Lennie had taken. George stopped
whistling and listened. “Poor bastard,” he said softly,
and then went on whistling again.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p66">p66</span>In a moment Lennie came crashing back through
the brush. He carried one small willow stick in his
hand. George sat up. “Awright,” he said brusquely.
“Gi’me that mouse!”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p67">p67</span>But Lennie made an elaborate pantomime of innocence.
“What mouse, George? I ain’t got no mouse.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p68">p68</span>George held out his hand. “Come on. Give it to me.
You ain’t puttin’ nothing over.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p69">p69</span>Lennie hesitated, backed away, looked wildly at the
brush line as though he contemplated running for his
freedom. George said coldly, “You gonna give me
that mouse or do I have to sock you?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p70">p70</span>“Give you what, George?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p71">p71</span>“You know God damn well what. I want that
mouse.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p72">p72</span>Lennie reluctantly reached into his pocket. His
voice broke a little. “I don’t know why I can’t keep it.
It ain’t nobody’s mouse. I didn’t steal it. I found it
lyin’ right beside the road.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p73">p73</span>George’s hand remained outstretched imperiously.
Slowly, like a terrier who doesn’t want to bring a
ball to its master, Lennie approached, drew back, approached
again. George snapped his fingers sharply,
and at the sound Lennie laid the mouse in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p74">p74</span>“I wasn’t doin’ nothing bad with it, George. Jus’
strokin’ it.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p75">p75</span>George stood up and threw the mouse as far as he
could into the darkening brush, and then he stepped
to the pool and washed his hands. “You crazy fool.
Don’t you think I could see your feet was wet where
you went acrost the river to get it?” He heard Lennie’s
whimpering cry and wheeled about. “Blubberin’
like a baby! Jesus Christ! A big guy like you.” Lennie’s
lip quivered and tears started in his eyes. “Aw,
Lennie!” George put his hand on Lennie’s shoulder.
“I ain’t takin’ it away jus’ for meanness. That mouse
ain’t fresh, Lennie; and besides, you’ve broke it pettin’
it. You get another mouse that’s fresh and I’ll let you
keep it a little while.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p76">p76</span>Lennie sat down on the ground and hung his head
dejectedly. “I don’t know where there is no other
mouse. I remember a lady used to give ’em to me—ever’
one she got. But that lady ain’t here.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p77">p77</span>George scoffed. “Lady, huh? Don’t even remember
who that lady was. That was your own Aunt Clara.
An’ she stopped givin’ ’em to ya. You always killed
’em.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p78">p78</span>Lennie looked sadly up at him. “They was so little,”
he said, apologetically. “I’d pet ’em, and pretty soon
they bit my fingers and I pinched their heads a little
and then they was dead—because they was so little.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p79">p79</span>“I wish’t we’d get the rabbits pretty soon, George.
They ain’t so little.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p80">p80</span>“The hell with the rabbits. An’ you ain’t to be
trusted with no live mice. Your Aunt Clara give you
a rubber mouse and you wouldn’t have nothing to do
with it.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p81">p81</span>“It wasn’t no good to pet,” said Lennie.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p82">p82</span>The flame of the sunset lifted from the mountain-tops
and dusk came into the valley, and a half darkness
came in among the willows and the sycamores. A big
carp rose to the surface of the pool, gulped air and
then sank mysteriously into the dark water again, leaving
widening rings on the water. Overhead the leaves
whisked again and little puffs of willow cotton blew
down and landed on the pool’s surface.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p83">p83</span>“You gonna get that wood?” George demanded.
“There’s plenty right up against the back of that sycamore.
Floodwater wood. Now you get it.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p84">p84</span>Lennie went behind the tree and brought out a litter
of dried leaves and twigs. He threw them in a heap on
the old ash pile and went back for more and more. It
was almost night now. A dove’s wings whistled over
the water. George walked to the fire pile and lighted
the dry leaves. The flame cracked up among the twigs
and fell to work. George undid his bindle and brought
out three cans of beans. He stood them about the fire,
close in against the blaze, but not quite touching the
flame.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p85">p85</span>“There’s enough beans for four men,” George said.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p86">p86</span>Lennie watched him from over the fire. He said
patiently, “I like ’em with ketchup.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p87">p87</span>“Well, we ain’t got any,” George exploded. “Whatever
we ain’t got, that’s what you want. God a’mighty,
if I was alone I could live so easy. I could go get a job
an’ work, an’ no trouble. No mess at all, and when the
end of the month come I could take my fifty bucks
and go into town and get whatever I want. Why, I
could stay in a cat house all night. I could eat any
place I want, hotel or any place, and order any damn
thing I could think of. An’ I could do all that every
damn month. Get a gallon of whisky, or set in a pool
room and play cards or shoot pool.” Lennie knelt and
looked over the fire at the angry George. And Lennie’s
face was drawn with terror. “An’ whatta I got,”
George went on furiously. “I got you! You can’t keep
a job and you lose me ever’ job I get. Jus’ keep me
shovin’ all over the country all the time. An’ that ain’t
the worst. You get in trouble. You do bad things and
I got to get you out.” His voice rose nearly to a shout.
“You crazy son-of-a-bitch. You keep me in hot water
all the time.” He took on the elaborate manner of little
girls when they are mimicking one another. “Jus’
wanted to feel that girl’s dress—jus’ wanted to pet it
like it was a mouse—— Well, how the hell did she
know you jus’ wanted to feel her dress? She jerks back
and you hold on like it was a mouse. She yells and we
got to hide in a irrigation ditch all day with guys
lookin’ for us, and we got to sneak out in the dark and
get outta the country. All the time somethin’ like that—all
the time. I wisht I could put you in a cage with
about a million mice an’ let you have fun.” His anger
left him suddenly. He looked across the fire at Lennie’s
anguished face, and then he looked ashamedly at
the flames.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p88">p88</span>It was quite dark now, but the fire lighted the trunks
of the trees and the curving branches overhead. Lennie
crawled slowly and cautiously around the fire until
he was close to George. He sat back on his heels.
George turned the bean cans so that another side faced
the fire. He pretended to be unaware of Lennie so
close beside him.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p89">p89</span>“George,” very softly. No answer. “George!”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p90">p90</span>“Whatta you want?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p91">p91</span>“I was only foolin’, George. I don’t want no
ketchup. I wouldn’t eat no ketchup if it was right here
beside me.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p92">p92</span>“If it was here, you could have some.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p93">p93</span>“But I wouldn’t eat none, George. I’d leave it all
for you. You could cover your beans with it and I
wouldn’t touch none of it.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p94">p94</span>George still stared morosely at the fire. “When I
think of the swell time I could have without you, I go
nuts. I never get no peace.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p95">p95</span>Lennie still knelt. He looked off into the darkness
across the river. “George, you want I should go away
and leave you alone?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p96">p96</span>“Where the hell could you go?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p97">p97</span>“Well, I could. I could go off in the hills there. Some
place I’d find a cave.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p98">p98</span>“Yeah? How’d you eat. You ain’t got sense enough
to find nothing to eat.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p99">p99</span>“I’d find things, George. I don’t need no nice food
with ketchup. I’d lay out in the sun and nobody’d hurt
me. An’ if I foun’ a mouse, I could keep it. Nobody’d
take it away from me.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p100">p100</span>George looked quickly and searchingly at him. “I
been mean, ain’t I?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p101">p101</span>“If you don’ want me I can go off in the hills an’
find a cave. I can go away any time.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p102">p102</span>“No—look! I was jus’ foolin’, Lennie. ’Cause I want
you to stay with me. Trouble with mice is you always
kill ’em.” He paused. “Tell you what I’ll do, Lennie.
First chance I get I’ll give you a pup. Maybe you
wouldn’t kill it. That’d be better than mice. And you
could pet it harder.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p103">p103</span>Lennie avoided the bait. He had sensed his advantage.
“If you don’t want me, you only jus’ got to say
so, and I’ll go off in those hills right there—right up
in those hills and live by myself. An’ I won’t get no
mice stole from me.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p104">p104</span>George said, “I want you to stay with me, Lennie.
Jesus Christ, somebody’d shoot you for a coyote if you
was by yourself. No, you stay with me. Your Aunt
Clara wouldn’t like you running off by yourself, even
if she is dead.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p105">p105</span>Lennie spoke craftily, “Tell me—like you done
before.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p106">p106</span>“Tell you what?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p107">p107</span>“About the rabbits.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p108">p108</span>George snapped, “You ain’t gonna put nothing over
on me.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p109">p109</span>Lennie pleaded, “Come on, George. Tell me. Please,
George. Like you done before.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p110">p110</span>“You get a kick outta that, don’t you? Awright,
I’ll tell you, and then we’ll eat our supper.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p111">p111</span>George’s voice became deeper. He repeated his
words rhythmically as though he had said them many
times before. “Guys like us, that work on ranches, are
the loneliest guys in the world. They got no family.
They don’t belong no place. They come to a ranch an’
work up a stake and then they go inta town and blow
their stake, and the first thing you know they’re
poundin’ their tail on some other ranch. They ain’t got
nothing to look ahead to.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p112">p112</span>Lennie was delighted. “That’s it—that’s it. Now tell
how it is with us.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p113">p113</span>George went on. “With us it ain’t like that. We got
a future. We got somebody to talk to that gives a
damn about us. We don’t have to sit in no bar room
blowin’ in our jack jus’ because we got no place else
to go. If them other guys gets in jail they can rot for
all anybody gives a damn. But not us.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p114">p114</span>Lennie broke in. “<span class="it">But not us! An’ why? Because
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because I got you to look after me, and you got
me to look after you, and that’s why.</span>” He laughed
delightedly. “Go on now, George!”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p115">p115</span>“You got it by heart. You can do it yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p116">p116</span>“No, you. I forget some a’ the things. Tell about
how it’s gonna be.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p117">p117</span>“O.K. Someday—we’re gonna get the jack together
and we’re gonna have a little house and a couple of
acres an’ a cow and some pigs and——”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p118">p118</span>“<span class="it">An’ live off the fatta the lan’</span>,” Lennie shouted.
“An’ have <span class="it">rabbits</span>. Go on, George! Tell about what
we’re gonna have in the garden and about the rabbits
in the cages and about the rain in the winter and the
stove, and how thick the cream is on the milk like you
can hardly cut it. Tell about that, George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p119">p119</span>“Why’n’t you do it yourself? You know all of it.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p120">p120</span>“No .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you tell it. It ain’t the same if I tell it. Go
on .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. George. How I get to tend the rabbits.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p121">p121</span>“Well,” said George, “we’ll have a big vegetable
patch and a rabbit hutch and chickens. And when it
rains in the winter, we’ll just say the hell with goin’ to
work, and we’ll build up a fire in the stove and set
around it an’ listen to the rain comin’ down on the
roof—Nuts!” He took out his pocket knife. “I ain’t
got time for no more.” He drove his knife through the
top of one of the bean cans, sawed out the top and
passed the can to Lennie. Then he opened a second
can. From his side pocket he brought out two spoons
and passed one of them to Lennie.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p122">p122</span>They sat by the fire and filled their mouths with
beans and chewed mightily. A few beans slipped out
of the side of Lennie’s mouth. George gestured with
his spoon. “What you gonna say tomorrow when the
boss asks you questions?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p123">p123</span>Lennie stopped chewing and swallowed. His face
was concentrated. “I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I ain’t gonna .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. say a word.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p124">p124</span>“Good boy! That’s fine, Lennie! Maybe you’re
gettin’ better. When we get the coupla acres I can let
you tend the rabbits all right. ’Specially if you remember
as good as that.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p125">p125</span>Lennie choked with pride. “I can remember,” he
said.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p126">p126</span>George motioned with his spoon again. “Look, Lennie.
I want you to look around here. You can remember
this place, can’t you? The ranch is about a quarter
mile up that way. Just follow the river?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p127">p127</span>“Sure,” said Lennie. “I can remember this. Di’n’t I
remember about not gonna say a word?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p128">p128</span>“ ’Course you did. Well, look. Lennie—if you jus’
happen to get in trouble like you always done before,
I want you to come right here an’ hide in the brush.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p129">p129</span>“Hide in the brush,” said Lennie slowly.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p130">p130</span>“Hide in the brush till I come for you. Can you
remember that?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p131">p131</span>“Sure I can, George. Hide in the brush till you
come.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p132">p132</span>“But you ain’t gonna get in no trouble, because if
you do, I won’t let you tend the rabbits.” He threw
his empty bean can off into the brush.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p133">p133</span>“I won’t get in no trouble, George. I ain’t gonna
say a word.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p134">p134</span>“O.K. Bring your bindle over here by the fire. It’s
gonna be nice sleepin’ here. Lookin’ up, and the leaves.
Don’t build up no more fire. We’ll let her die down.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p135">p135</span>They made their beds on the sand, and as the blaze
dropped from the fire the sphere of light grew smaller;
the curling branches disappeared and only a faint glimmer
showed where the tree trunks were. From the
darkness Lennie called, “George—you asleep?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p136">p136</span>“No. Whatta you want?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p137">p137</span>“Let’s have different color rabbits, George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p138">p138</span>“Sure we will,” George said sleepily. “Red and blue
and green rabbits, Lennie. Millions of ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p139">p139</span>“Furry ones, George, like I seen in the fair in Sacramento.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p140">p140</span>“Sure, furry ones.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p141">p141</span>“ ’Cause I can jus’ as well go away, George, an’ live
in a cave.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p142">p142</span>“You can jus’ as well go to hell,” said George. “Shut
up now.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p143">p143</span>The red light dimmed on the coals. Up the hill from
the river a coyote yammered, and a dog answered from
the other side of the stream. The sycamore leaves
whispered in a little night breeze.</p>

<div><h1 id="2">2</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="counter" id="p144">p144</span><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> bunk house was a long, rectangular building.
Inside, the walls were whitewashed and the floor
unpainted. In three walls there were small, square
windows, and in the fourth, a solid door with a
wooden latch. Against the walls were eight bunks, five
of them made up with blankets and the other three
showing their burlap ticking. Over each bunk there
was nailed an apple box with the opening forward so
that it made two shelves for the personal belongings of
the occupant of the bunk. And these shelves were
loaded with little articles, soap and talcum powder,
razors and those Western magazines ranch men love to
read and scoff at and secretly believe. And there were
medicines on the shelves, and little vials, combs; and
from nails on the box sides, a few neckties. Near one
wall there was a black cast-iron stove, its stovepipe
going straight up through the ceiling. In the middle of
the room stood a big square table littered with playing
cards, and around it were grouped boxes for the players
to sit on.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p145">p145</span>At about ten o’clock in the morning the sun threw
a bright dust-laden bar through one of the side windows,
and in and out of the beam flies shot like rushing
stars.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p146">p146</span>The wooden latch raised. The door opened and a
tall, stoop-shouldered old man came in. He was dressed
in blue jeans and he carried a big push-broom in his left
hand. Behind him came George, and behind George,
Lennie.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p147">p147</span>“The boss was expectin’ you last night,” the old
man said. “He was sore as hell when you wasn’t here
to go out this morning.” He pointed with his right
arm, and out of the sleeve came a round stick-like
wrist, but no hand. “You can have them two beds
there,” he said, indicating two bunks near the stove.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p148">p148</span>George stepped over and threw his blankets down
on the burlap sack of straw that was a mattress. He
looked into his box shelf and then picked a small yellow
can from it. “Say. What the hell’s this?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p149">p149</span>“I don’t know,” said the old man.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p150">p150</span>“Says ‘positively kills lice, roaches and other
scourges.’ What the hell kind of bed you giving us,
anyways. We don’t want no pants rabbits.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p151">p151</span>The old swamper shifted his broom and held it between
his elbow and his side while he held out his hand
for the can. He studied the label carefully. “Tell you
what—” he said finally, “last guy that had this bed was
a blacksmith—hell of a nice fella and as clean a guy as
you want to meet. Used to wash his hands even <span class="it">after</span>
he ate.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p152">p152</span>“Then how come he got graybacks?” George was
working up a slow anger. Lennie put his bindle on the
neighboring bunk and sat down. He watched George
with open mouth.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p153">p153</span>“Tell you what,” said the old swamper. “This here
blacksmith—name of Whitey—was the kind of guy
that would put that stuff around even if there wasn’t
no bugs—just to make sure, see? Tell you what he
used to do—At meals he’d peel his boil’ potatoes, an’
he’d take out ever’ little spot, no matter what kind,
before he’d eat it. And if there was a red splotch on an
egg, he’d scrape it off. Finally quit about the food.
That’s the kinda guy he was—clean. Used ta dress
up Sundays even when he wasn’t going no place, put
on a necktie even, and then set in the bunk house.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p154">p154</span>“I ain’t so sure,” said George skeptically. “What did
you say he quit for?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p155">p155</span>The old man put the yellow can in his pocket, and
he rubbed his bristly white whiskers with his knuckles.
“Why .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. just quit, the way a guy will. Says it
was the food. Just wanted to move. Didn’t give no
other reason but the food. Just says ‘gimme my time’
one night, the way any guy would.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p156">p156</span>George lifted his tick and looked underneath it. He
leaned over and inspected the sacking closely. Immediately
Lennie got up and did the same with his bed.
Finally George seemed satisfied. He unrolled his bindle
and put things on the shelf, his razor and bar of soap,
his comb and bottle of pills, his liniment and leather
wristband. Then he made his bed up neatly with
blankets. The old man said, “I guess the boss’ll be out
here in a minute. He was sure burned when you wasn’t
here this morning. Come right in when we was eatin’
breakfast and says, ‘Where the hell’s them new men?’
An’ he give the stable buck hell, too.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p157">p157</span>George patted a wrinkle out of his bed, and sat
down. “Give the stable buck hell?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p158">p158</span>“Sure. Ya see the stable buck’s a nigger.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p159">p159</span>“Nigger, huh?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p160">p160</span>“Yeah. Nice fella too. Got a crooked back where a
horse kicked him. The boss gives him hell when he’s
mad. But the stable buck don’t give a damn about that.
He reads a lot. Got books in his room.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p161">p161</span>“What kind of a guy is the boss?” George asked.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p162">p162</span>“Well, he’s a pretty nice fella. Gets pretty mad
sometimes, but he’s pretty nice. Tell ya what—know
what he done Christmas? Brang a gallon of whisky
right in here and says, ‘Drink hearty boys. Christmas
comes but once a year.’ ”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p163">p163</span>“The hell he did! Whole gallon?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p164">p164</span>“Yes sir. Jesus, we had fun. They let the nigger
come in that night. Little skinner name of Smitty took
after the nigger. Done pretty good, too. The guys
wouldn’t let him use his feet, so the nigger got him. If
he coulda used his feet, Smitty says he woulda killed
the nigger. The guys said on account of the nigger’s
got a crooked back, Smitty can’t use his feet.” He
paused in relish of the memory. “After that the guys
went into Soledad and raised hell. I didn’t go in there.
I ain’t got the poop no more.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p165">p165</span>Lennie was just finishing making his bed. The
wooden latch raised again and the door opened. A
little stocky man stood in the open doorway. He wore
blue jean trousers, a flannel shirt, a black, unbuttoned
vest and a black coat. His thumbs were stuck in his
belt, on each side of a square steel buckle. On his head
was a soiled brown Stetson hat, and he wore high-heeled
boots and spurs to prove he was not a laboring
man.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p166">p166</span>The old swamper looked quickly at him, and then
shuffled to the door rubbing his whiskers with his
knuckles as he went. “Them guys just come,” he said,
and shuffled past the boss and out the door.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p167">p167</span>The boss stepped into the room with the short,
quick steps of a fat-legged man. “I wrote Murray and
Ready I wanted two men this morning. You got your
work slips?” George reached into his pocket and produced
the slips and handed them to the boss. “It wasn’t
Murray and Ready’s fault. Says right here on the slip
that you was to be here for work this morning.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p168">p168</span>George looked down at his feet. “Bus driver give us
a bum steer,” he said. “We hadda walk ten miles. Says
we was here when we wasn’t. We couldn’t get no rides
in the morning.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p169">p169</span>The boss squinted his eyes. “Well, I had to send out
the grain teams short two buckers. Won’t do any good
to go out now till after dinner.” He pulled his time
book out of his pocket and opened it where a pencil
was stuck between the leaves. George scowled meaningfully
at Lennie, and Lennie nodded to show that he
understood. The boss licked his pencil. “What’s your
name?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p170">p170</span>“George Milton.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p171">p171</span>“And what’s yours?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p172">p172</span>George said, “His name’s Lennie Small.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p173">p173</span>The names were entered in the book. “Le’s see, this
is the twentieth, noon the twentieth.” He closed the
book. “Where you boys been working?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p174">p174</span>“Up around Weed,” said George.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p175">p175</span>“You, too?” to Lennie.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p176">p176</span>“Yeah, him too,” said George.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p177">p177</span>The boss pointed a playful finger at Lennie. “He
ain’t much of a talker, is he?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p178">p178</span>“No, he ain’t, but he’s sure a hell of a good worker.
Strong as a bull.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p179">p179</span>Lennie smiled to himself. “Strong as a bull,” he
repeated.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p180">p180</span>George scowled at him, and Lennie dropped his
head in shame at having forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p181">p181</span>The boss said suddenly, “Listen, Small!” Lennie
raised his head. “What can you do?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p182">p182</span>In a panic, Lennie looked at George for help. “He
can do anything you tell him,” said George. “He’s a
good skinner. He can rassel grain bags, drive a cultivator.
He can do anything. Just give him a try.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p183">p183</span>The boss turned on George. “Then why don’t you
let him answer? What you trying to put over?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p184">p184</span>George broke in loudly, “Oh! I ain’t saying he’s
bright. He ain’t. But I say he’s a God damn good
worker. He can put up a four hundred pound bale.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p185">p185</span>The boss deliberately put the little book in his
pocket. He hooked his thumbs in his belt and squinted
one eye nearly closed. “Say—what you sellin’?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p186">p186</span>“Huh?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p187">p187</span>“I said what stake you got in this guy? You takin’
his pay away from him?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p188">p188</span>“No, ’course I ain’t. Why ya think I’m sellin’ him
out?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p189">p189</span>“Well, I never seen one guy take so much trouble
for another guy. I just like to know what your interest
is.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p190">p190</span>George said, “He’s my .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. cousin. I told his old
lady I’d take care of him. He got kicked in the head
by a horse when he was a kid. He’s awright. Just ain’t
bright. But he can do anything you tell him.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p191">p191</span>The boss turned half away. “Well, God knows he
don’t need any brains to buck barley bags. But don’t
you try to put nothing over, Milton. I got my eye on
you. Why’d you quit in Weed?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p192">p192</span>“Job was done,” said George promptly.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p193">p193</span>“What kinda job?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p194">p194</span>“We .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we was diggin’ a cesspool.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p195">p195</span>“All right. But don’t try to put nothing over, ’cause
you can’t get away with nothing. I seen wise guys
before. Go on out with the grain teams after dinner.
They’re pickin’ up barley at the threshing machine.
Go out with Slim’s team.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p196">p196</span>“Slim?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p197">p197</span>“Yeah. Big tall skinner. You’ll see him at dinner.”
He turned abruptly and went to the door, but before
he went out he turned and looked for a long moment
at the two men.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p198">p198</span>When the sound of his footsteps had died away,
George turned on Lennie. “So you wasn’t gonna say a
word. You was gonna leave your big flapper shut and
leave me do the talkin’. Damn near lost us the job.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p199">p199</span>Lennie stared hopelessly at his hands. “I forgot,
George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p200">p200</span>“Yeah, you forgot. You always forget, an’ I got to
talk you out of it.” He sat down heavily on the bunk.
“Now he’s got his eye on us. Now we got to be careful
and not make no slips. You keep your big flapper
shut after this.” He fell morosely silent.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p201">p201</span>“George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p202">p202</span>“What you want now?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p203">p203</span>“I wasn’t kicked in the head with no horse, was I,
George?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p204">p204</span>“Be a damn good thing if you was,” George said
viciously. “Save ever’body a hell of a lot of trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p205">p205</span>“You said I was your cousin, George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p206">p206</span>“Well, that was a lie. An’ I’m damn glad it was. If I
was a relative of yours I’d shoot myself.” He stopped
suddenly, stepped to the open front door and peered
out. “Say, what the hell you doin’ listenin’?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p207">p207</span>The old man came slowly into the room. He had his
broom in his hand. And at his heels there walked a
dragfooted sheep dog, gray of muzzle, and with pale,
blind old eyes. The dog struggled lamely to the side of
the room and lay down, grunting softly to himself and
licking his grizzled, moth-eaten coat. The swamper
watched him until he was settled. “I wasn’t listenin’.
I was jus’ standin’ in the shade a minute scratchin’ my
dog. I jus’ now finished swampin’ out the wash house.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p208">p208</span>“You was pokin’ your big ears into our business,”
George said. “I don’t like nobody to get nosey.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p209">p209</span>The old man looked uneasily from George to Lennie,
and then back. “I jus’ come there,” he said. “I
didn’t hear nothing you guys was sayin’. I ain’t interested
in nothing you was sayin’. A guy on a ranch
don’t never listen nor he don’t ast no questions.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p210">p210</span>“Damn right he don’t,” said George, slightly mollified,
“not if he wants to stay workin’ long.” But he
was reassured by the swamper’s defense. “Come on in
and set down a minute,” he said. “That’s a hell of an
old dog.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p211">p211</span>“Yeah. I had ’im ever since he was a pup. God, he
was a good sheep dog when he was younger.” He
stood his broom against the wall and he rubbed his
white bristled cheek with his knuckles. “How’d you
like the boss?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p212">p212</span>“Pretty good. Seemed awright.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p213">p213</span>“He’s a nice fella,” the swamper agreed. “You got
to take him right.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p214">p214</span>At that moment a young man came into the bunk
house; a thin young man with a brown face, with
brown eyes and a head of tightly curled hair. He wore
a work glove on his left hand, and, like the boss, he
wore high-heeled boots. “Seen my old man?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p215">p215</span>The swamper said, “He was here jus’ a minute ago,
Curley. Went over to the cook house, I think.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p216">p216</span>“I’ll try to catch him,” said Curley. His eyes passed
over the new men and he stopped. He glanced coldly
at George and then at Lennie. His arms gradually bent
at the elbows and his hands closed into fists. He stiffened
and went into a slight crouch. His glance was
at once calculating and pugnacious. Lennie squirmed
under the look and shifted his feet nervously. Curley
stepped gingerly close to him. “You the new guys the
old man was waitin’ for?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p217">p217</span>“We just come in,” said George.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p218">p218</span>“Let the big guy talk.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p219">p219</span>Lennie twisted with embarrassment.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p220">p220</span>George said, “S’pose he don’t want to talk?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p221">p221</span>Curley lashed his body around. “By Christ, he’s
gotta talk when he’s spoke to. What the hell are you
gettin’ into it for?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p222">p222</span>“We travel together,” said George coldly.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p223">p223</span>“Oh, so it’s that way.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p224">p224</span>George was tense, and motionless. “Yeah, it’s that
way.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p225">p225</span>Lennie was looking helplessly to George for instruction.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p226">p226</span>“An’ you won’t let the big guy talk, is that it?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p227">p227</span>“He can talk if he wants to tell you anything.” He
nodded slightly to Lennie.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p228">p228</span>“We jus’ come in,” said Lennie softly.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p229">p229</span>Curley stared levelly at him. “Well, nex’ time you
answer when you’re spoke to.” He turned toward the
door and walked out, and his elbows were still bent
out a little.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p230">p230</span>George watched him out, and then he turned back
to the swamper. “Say, what the hell’s he got on his
shoulder? Lennie didn’t do nothing to him.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p231">p231</span>The old man looked cautiously at the door to make
sure no one was listening. “That’s the boss’s son,” he
said quietly. “Curley’s pretty handy. He done quite a
bit in the ring. He’s a lightweight, and he’s handy.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p232">p232</span>“Well, let him be handy,” said George. “He don’t
have to take after Lennie. Lennie didn’t do nothing to
him. What’s he got against Lennie?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p233">p233</span>The swamper considered.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “Well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tell you
what. Curley’s like a lot of little guys. He hates big
guys. He’s alla time picking scraps with big guys. Kind
of like he’s mad at ’em because he ain’t a big guy. You
seen little guys like that, ain’t you? Always scrappy?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p234">p234</span>“Sure,” said George. “I seen plenty tough little guys.
But this Curley better not make no mistakes about
Lennie. Lennie ain’t handy, but this Curley punk is
gonna get hurt if he messes around with Lennie.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p235">p235</span>“Well, Curley’s pretty handy,” the swamper said
skeptically. “Never did seem right to me. S’pose
Curley jumps a big guy an’ licks him. Ever’body says
what a game guy Curley is. And s’pose he does the
same thing and gets licked. Then ever’body says the
big guy oughtta pick somebody his own size, and
maybe they gang up on the big guy. Never did seem
right to me. Seems like Curley ain’t givin’ nobody a
chance.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p236">p236</span>George was watching the door. He said ominously,
“Well, he better watch out for Lennie. Lennie ain’t no
fighter, but Lennie’s strong and quick and Lennie
don’t know no rules.” He walked to the square table
and sat down on one of the boxes. He gathered some
of the cards together and shuffled them.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p237">p237</span>The old man sat down on another box. “Don’t tell
Curley I said none of this. He’d slough me. He just
don’t give a damn. Won’t ever get canned ’cause his
old man’s the boss.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p238">p238</span>George cut the cards and began turning them over,
looking at each one and throwing it down on a pile.
He said, “This guy Curley sounds like a son-of-a-bitch
to me. I don’t like mean little guys.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p239">p239</span>“Seems to me like he’s worse lately,” said the
swamper. “He got married a couple of weeks ago.
Wife lives over in the boss’s house. Seems like Curley
is cockier’n ever since he got married.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p240">p240</span>George grunted, “Maybe he’s showin’ off for his
wife.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p241">p241</span>The swamper warmed to his gossip. “You seen that
glove on his left hand?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p242">p242</span>“Yeah. I seen it.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p243">p243</span>“Well, that glove’s fulla vaseline.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p244">p244</span>“Vaseline? What the hell for?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p245">p245</span>“Well, I tell ya what—Curley says he’s keepin’ that
hand soft for his wife.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p246">p246</span>George studied the cards absorbedly. “That’s a dirty
thing to tell around,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p247">p247</span>The old man was reassured. He had drawn a derogatory
statement from George. He felt safe now, and
he spoke more confidently. “Wait’ll you see Curley’s
wife.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p248">p248</span>George cut the cards again and put out a solitaire lay,
slowly and deliberately. “Purty?” he asked casually.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p249">p249</span>“Yeah. Purty .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but——”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p250">p250</span>George studied his cards. “But what?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p251">p251</span>“Well—she got the eye.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p252">p252</span>“Yeah? Married two weeks and got the eye? Maybe
that’s why Curley’s pants is full of ants.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p253">p253</span>“I seen her give Slim the eye. Slim’s a jerkline skinner.
Hell of a nice fella. Slim don’t need to wear no
high-heeled boots on a grain team. I seen her give Slim
the eye. Curley never seen it. An’ I seen her give Carlson
the eye.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p254">p254</span>George pretended a lack of interest. “Looks like we
was gonna have fun.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p255">p255</span>The swamper stood up from his box. “Know what
I think?” George did not answer. “Well, I think
Curley’s married .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a tart.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p256">p256</span>“He ain’t the first,” said George. “There’s plenty
done that.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p257">p257</span>The old man moved toward the door, and his ancient
dog lifted his head and peered about, and then
got painfully to his feet to follow. “I gotta be settin’
out the wash basins for the guys. The teams’ll be in
before long. You guys gonna buck barley?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p258">p258</span>“Yeah.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p259">p259</span>“You won’t tell Curley nothing I said?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p260">p260</span>“Hell no.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p261">p261</span>“Well, you look her over, mister. You see if she
ain’t a tart.” He stepped out the door into the brilliant
sunshine.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p262">p262</span>George laid down his cards thoughtfully, turned his
piles of three. He built four clubs on his ace pile. The
sun square was on the floor now, and the flies whipped
through it like sparks. A sound of jingling harness and
the croak of heavy-laden axles sounded from outside.
From the distance came a clear call. “Stable Buck—ooh,
sta-able Buck!” And then, “Where the hell is that
God damn nigger?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p263">p263</span>George stared at his solitaire lay, and then he
flounced the cards together and turned around to Lennie.
Lennie was lying down on the bunk watching
him.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p264">p264</span>“Look, Lennie! This here ain’t no set up. I’m scared.
You gonna have trouble with that Curley guy. I seen
that kind before. He was kinda feelin’ you out. He
figures he’s got you scared and he’s gonna take a sock
at you the first chance he gets.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p265">p265</span>Lennie’s eyes were frightened. “I don’t want no
trouble,” he said plaintively. “Don’t let him sock me,
George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p266">p266</span>George got up and went over to Lennie’s bunk and
sat down on it. “I hate that kinda bastard,” he said. “I
seen plenty of ’em. Like the old guy says, Curley
don’t take no chances. He always wins.” He thought
for a moment. “If he tangles with you, Lennie, we’re
gonna get the can. Don’t make no mistake about that.
He’s the boss’s son. Look, Lennie. You try to keep
away from him, will you? Don’t never speak to him.
If he comes in here you move clear to the other side of
the room. Will you do that, Lennie?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p267">p267</span>“I don’t want no trouble,” Lennie mourned. “I
never done nothing to him.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p268">p268</span>“Well, that won’t do you no good if Curley wants
to plug himself up for a fighter. Just don’t have nothing
to do with him. Will you remember?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p269">p269</span>“Sure, George. I ain’t gonna say a word.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p270">p270</span>The sound of the approaching grain teams was
louder, thud of big hooves on hard ground, drag of
brakes and the jingle of trace chains. Men were calling
back and forth from the teams. George, sitting on the
bunk beside Lennie, frowned as he thought. Lennie
asked timidly, “You ain’t mad, George?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p271">p271</span>“I ain’t mad at you. I’m mad at this here Curley
bastard. I hoped we was gonna get a little stake together—maybe
a hundred dollars.” His tone grew decisive.
“You keep away from Curley, Lennie.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p272">p272</span>“Sure I will, George. I won’t say a word.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p273">p273</span>“Don’t let him pull you in—but—if the son-of-a-bitch
socks you—let ’im have it.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p274">p274</span>“Let ’im have what, George?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p275">p275</span>“Never mind, never mind. I’ll tell you when. I hate
that kind of a guy. Look, Lennie, if you get in any
kind of trouble, you remember what I told you to do?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p276">p276</span>Lennie raised up on his elbow. His face contorted
with thought. Then his eyes moved sadly to George’s
face. “If I get in any trouble, you ain’t gonna let me
tend the rabbits.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p277">p277</span>“That’s not what I meant. You remember where we
slep’ last night? Down by the river?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p278">p278</span>“Yeah. I remember. Oh, sure I remember! I go there
an’ hide in the brush.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p279">p279</span>“Hide till I come for you. Don’t let nobody see you.
Hide in the brush by the river. Say that over.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p280">p280</span>“Hide in the brush by the river, down in the brush
by the river.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p281">p281</span>“If you get in trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p282">p282</span>“If I get in trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p283">p283</span>A brake screeched outside. A call came, “Stable—Buck.
Oh! Sta-able Buck.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p284">p284</span>George said, “Say it over to yourself, Lennie, so you
won’t forget it.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p285">p285</span>Both men glanced up, for the rectangle of sunshine
in the doorway was cut off. A girl was standing there
looking in. She had full, rouged lips and wide-spaced
eyes, heavily made up. Her fingernails were red. Her
hair hung in little rolled clusters, like sausages. She
wore a cotton house dress and red mules, on the insteps
of which were little bouquets of red ostrich feathers.
“I’m lookin’ for Curley,” she said. Her voice had a
nasal, brittle quality.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p286">p286</span>George looked away from her and then back. “He
was in here a minute ago, but he went.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p287">p287</span>“Oh!” She put her hands behind her back and
leaned against the door frame so that her body was
thrown forward. “You’re the new fellas that just
come, ain’t ya?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p288">p288</span>“Yeah.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p289">p289</span>Lennie’s eyes moved down over her body, and
though she did not seem to be looking at Lennie she
bridled a little. She looked at her fingernails. “Sometimes
Curley’s in here,” she explained.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p290">p290</span>George said brusquely, “Well he ain’t now.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p291">p291</span>“If he ain’t, I guess I better look some place else,”
she said playfully.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p292">p292</span>Lennie watched her, fascinated. George said, “If I
see him, I’ll pass the word you was looking for him.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p293">p293</span>She smiled archly and twitched her body. “Nobody
can’t blame a person for lookin’,” she said. There were
footsteps behind her, going by. She turned her head.
“Hi, Slim,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p294">p294</span>Slim’s voice came through the door. “Hi, Good-lookin’.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p295">p295</span>“I’m tryin’ to find Curley, Slim.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p296">p296</span>“Well, you ain’t tryin’ very hard. I seen him goin’
in your house.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p297">p297</span>She was suddenly apprehensive. “ ’Bye, boys,” she
called into the bunk house, and she hurried away.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p298">p298</span>George looked around at Lennie. “Jesus, what a
tramp,” he said. “So that’s what Curley picks for a
wife.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p299">p299</span>“She’s purty,” said Lennie defensively.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p300">p300</span>“Yeah, and she’s sure hidin’ it. Curley got his work
ahead of him. Bet she’d clear out for twenty bucks.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p301">p301</span>Lennie still stared at the doorway where she had
been. “Gosh, she was purty.” He smiled admiringly.
George looked quickly down at him and then he took
him by an ear and shook him.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p302">p302</span>“Listen to me, you crazy bastard,” he said fiercely.
“Don’t you even take a look at that bitch. I don’t care
what she says and what she does. I seen ’em poison
before, but I never seen no piece of jail bait worse
than her. You leave her be.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p303">p303</span>Lennie tried to disengage his ear. “I never done
nothing, George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p304">p304</span>“No, you never. But when she was standin’ in the
doorway showin’ her legs, you wasn’t lookin’ the
other way, neither.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p305">p305</span>“I never meant no harm, George. Honest I never.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p306">p306</span>“Well, you keep away from her, ’cause she’s a rat-trap
if I ever seen one. You let Curley take the rap. He
let himself in for it. Glove fulla vaseline,” George said
disgustedly. “An’ I bet he’s eatin’ raw eggs and writin’
to the patent medicine houses.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p307">p307</span>Lennie cried out suddenly—“I don’ like this place,
George. This ain’t no good place. I wanna get outa
here.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p308">p308</span>“We gotta keep it till we get a stake. We can’t help
it, Lennie. We’ll get out jus’ as soon as we can. I don’t
like it no better than you do.” He went back to the
table and set out a new solitaire hand. “No, I don’t like
it,” he said. “For two bits I’d shove out of here. If we
can get jus’ a few dollars in the poke we’ll shove off
and go up the American River and pan gold. We can
make maybe a couple of dollars a day there, and we
might hit a pocket.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p309">p309</span>Lennie leaned eagerly toward him. “Le’s go, George.
Le’s get outta here. It’s mean here.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p310">p310</span>“We gotta stay,” George said shortly. “Shut up
now. The guys’ll be comin’ in.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p311">p311</span>From the washroom nearby came the sound of running
water and rattling basins. George studied the
cards. “Maybe we oughtta wash up,” he said. “But
we ain’t done nothing to get dirty.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p312">p312</span>A tall man stood in the doorway. He held a crushed
Stetson hat under his arm while he combed his long,
black, damp hair straight back. Like the others he wore
blue jeans and a short denim jacket. When he had finished
combing his hair he moved into the room, and he
moved with a majesty only achieved by royalty and
master craftsmen. He was a jerkline skinner, the prince
of the ranch, capable of driving ten, sixteen, even
twenty mules with a single line to the leaders. He was
capable of killing a fly on the wheeler’s butt with a
bull whip without touching the mule. There was a
gravity in his manner and a quiet so profound that all
talk stopped when he spoke. His authority was so
great that his word was taken on any subject, be it
politics or love. This was Slim, the jerkline skinner.
His hatchet face was ageless. He might have been
thirty-five or fifty. His ear heard more than was said
to him, and his slow speech had overtones not of
thought, but of understanding beyond thought. His
hands, large and lean, were as delicate in their action
as those of a temple dancer.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p313">p313</span>He smoothed out his crushed hat, creased it in the
middle and put it on. He looked kindly at the two in
the bunk house. “It’s brighter’n a bitch outside,” he
said gently. “Can’t hardly see nothing in here. You the
new guys?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p314">p314</span>“Just come,” said George.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p315">p315</span>“Gonna buck barley?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p316">p316</span>“That’s what the boss says.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p317">p317</span>Slim sat down on a box across the table from
George. He studied the solitaire hand that was upside
down to him. “Hope you get on my team,” he said.
His voice was very gentle. “I gotta pair of punks on
my team that don’t know a barley bag from a blue
ball. You guys ever bucked any barley?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p318">p318</span>“Hell, yes,” said George. “I ain’t nothing to scream
about, but that big bastard there can put up more grain
alone than most pairs can.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p319">p319</span>Lennie, who had been following the conversation
back and forth with his eyes, smiled complacently at
the compliment. Slim looked approvingly at George
for having given the compliment. He leaned over the
table and snapped the corner of a loose card. “You
guys travel around together?” His tone was friendly.
It invited confidence without demanding it.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p320">p320</span>“Sure,” said George. “We kinda look after each
other.” He indicated Lennie with his thumb. “He ain’t
bright. Hell of a good worker, though. Hell of a nice
fella, but he ain’t bright. I’ve knew him for a long
time.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p321">p321</span>Slim looked through George and beyond him. “Ain’t
many guys travel around together,” he mused. “I don’t
know why. Maybe ever’body in the whole damn
world is scared of each other.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p322">p322</span>“It’s a lot nicer to go around with a guy you know,”
said George.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p323">p323</span>A powerful, big-stomached man came into the bunk
house. His head still dripped water from the scrubbing
and dousing. “Hi, Slim,” he said, and then stopped and
stared at George and Lennie.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p324">p324</span>“These guys jus’ come,” said Slim by way of introduction.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p325">p325</span>“Glad ta meet ya,” the big man said. “My name’s
Carlson.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p326">p326</span>“I’m George Milton. This here’s Lennie Small.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p327">p327</span>“Glad ta meet ya,” Carlson said again. “He ain’t
very small.” He chuckled softly at his joke. “Ain’t
small at all,” he repeated. “Meant to ask you, Slim—how’s
your bitch? I seen she wasn’t under your wagon
this morning.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p328">p328</span>“She slang her pups last night,” said Slim. “Nine of
’em. I drowned four of ’em right off. She couldn’t
feed that many.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p329">p329</span>“Got five left, huh?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p330">p330</span>“Yeah, five. I kept the biggest.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p331">p331</span>“What kinda dogs you think they’re gonna be?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p332">p332</span>“I dunno,” said Slim. “Some kinda shepherds, I
guess. That’s the most kind I seen around here when
she was in heat.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p333">p333</span>Carlson went on, “Got five pups, huh. Gonna keep
all of ’em?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p334">p334</span>“I dunno. Have to keep ’em a while so they can
drink Lulu’s milk.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p335">p335</span>Carlson said thoughtfully, “Well, looka here, Slim.
I been thinkin’. That dog of Candy’s is so God damn
old he can’t hardly walk. Stinks like hell, too. Ever’
time he comes into the bunk house I can smell him for
two, three days. Why’n’t you get Candy to shoot his
old dog and give him one of the pups to raise up? I can
smell that dog a mile away. Got no teeth, damn near
blind, can’t eat. Candy feeds him milk. He can’t chew
nothing else.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p336">p336</span>George had been staring intently at Slim. Suddenly
a triangle began to ring outside, slowly at first, and
then faster and faster until the beat of it disappeared
into one ringing sound. It stopped as suddenly as it
had started.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p337">p337</span>“There she goes,” said Carlson.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p338">p338</span>Outside, there was a burst of voices as a group of
men went by.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p339">p339</span>Slim stood up slowly and with dignity. “You guys
better come on while they’s still something to eat.
Won’t be nothing left in a couple of minutes.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p340">p340</span>Carlson stepped back to let Slim precede him, and
then the two of them went out the door.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p341">p341</span>Lennie was watching George excitedly. George
rumpled his cards into a messy pile. “Yeah!” George
said, “I heard him, Lennie. I’ll ask him.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p342">p342</span>“A brown and white one,” Lennie cried excitedly.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p343">p343</span>“Come on. Le’s get dinner. I don’t know whether
he got a brown and white one.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p344">p344</span>Lennie didn’t move from his bunk. “You ask him
right away, George, so he won’t kill no more of ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p345">p345</span>“Sure. Come on now, get up on your feet.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p346">p346</span>Lennie rolled off his bunk and stood up, and the
two of them started for the door. Just as they reached
it, Curley bounced in.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p347">p347</span>“You seen a girl around here?” he demanded angrily.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p348">p348</span>George said coldly. “ ’Bout half an hour ago maybe.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p349">p349</span>“Well what the hell was she doin’?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p350">p350</span>George stood still, watching the angry little man.
He said insultingly, “She said—she was lookin’ for
you.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p351">p351</span>Curley seemed really to see George for the first
time. His eyes flashed over George, took in his height,
measured his reach, looked at his trim middle. “Well,
which way’d she go?” he demanded at last.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p352">p352</span>“I dunno,” said George. “I didn’t watch her go.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p353">p353</span>Curley scowled at him, and turning, hurried out the
door.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p354">p354</span>George said, “Ya know, Lennie, I’m scared I’m
gonna tangle with that bastard myself. I hate his guts.
Jesus Christ! Come on. They won’t be a damn thing
left to eat.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p355">p355</span>They went out the door. The sunshine lay in a thin
line under the window. From a distance there could
be heard a rattle of dishes.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p356">p356</span>After a moment the ancient dog walked lamely in
through the open door. He gazed about with mild,
half-blind eyes. He sniffed, and then lay down and put
his head between his paws. Curley popped into the
doorway again and stood looking into the room. The
dog raised his head, but when Curley jerked out, the
grizzled head sank to the floor again.</p>

<div><h1 id="3">3</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="counter" id="p357">p357</span><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">A</span>lthough</span> there was evening brightness
showing through the windows of the bunk house, inside
it was dusk. Through the open door came the
thuds and occasional clangs of a horseshoe game, and
now and then the sound of voices raised in approval
or derision.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p358">p358</span>Slim and George came into the darkening bunk
house together. Slim reached up over the card table
and turned on the tin-shaded electric light. Instantly
the table was brilliant with light, and the cone of the
shade threw its brightness straight downward, leaving
the corners of the bunk house still in dusk. Slim sat
down on a box and George took his place opposite.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p359">p359</span>“It wasn’t nothing,” said Slim. “I would of had to
drowned most of ’em anyways. No need to thank me
about that.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p360">p360</span>George said, “It wasn’t much to you, maybe, but it
was a hell of a lot to him. Jesus Christ, I don’t know
how we’re gonna get him to sleep in here. He’ll want
to sleep right out in the barn with ’em. We’ll have
trouble keepin’ him from getting right in the box with
them pups.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p361">p361</span>“It wasn’t nothing,” Slim repeated. “Say, you sure
was right about him. Maybe he ain’t bright, but I never
seen such a worker. He damn near killed his partner
buckin’ barley. There ain’t nobody can keep up with
him. God awmighty I never seen such a strong guy.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p362">p362</span>George spoke proudly. “Jus’ tell Lennie what to do
an’ he’ll do it if it don’t take no figuring. He can’t
think of nothing to do himself, but he sure can take
orders.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p363">p363</span>There was a clang of horseshoe on iron stake outside
and a little cheer of voices.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p364">p364</span>Slim moved back slightly so the light was not on his
face. “Funny how you an’ him string along together.”
It was Slim’s calm invitation to confidence.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p365">p365</span>“What’s funny about it?” George demanded defensively.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p366">p366</span>“Oh, I dunno. Hardly none of the guys ever
travel together. I hardly never seen two guys travel
together. You know how the hands are, they just
come in and get their bunk and work a month, and
then they quit and go out alone. Never seem to give
a damn about nobody. It jus’ seems kinda funny a
cuckoo like him and a smart little guy like you
travelin’ together.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p367">p367</span>“He ain’t no cuckoo,” said George. “He’s dumb as
hell, but he ain’t crazy. An’ I ain’t so bright neither,
or I wouldn’t be buckin’ barley for my fifty and
found. If I was bright, if I was even a little bit smart,
I’d have my own little place, an’ I’d be bringin’ in
my own crops, ’stead of doin’ all the work and not
getting what comes up outa the ground.” George fell
silent. He wanted to talk. Slim neither encouraged nor
discouraged him. He just sat back quiet and receptive.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p368">p368</span>“It ain’t so funny, him an’ me goin’ aroun’ together,”
George said at last. “Him and me was both born
in Auburn. I knowed his Aunt Clara. She took him
when he was a baby and raised him up. When his
Aunt Clara died, Lennie just come along with me out
workin’. Got kinda used to each other after a little
while.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p369">p369</span>“Umm,” said Slim.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p370">p370</span>George looked over at Slim and saw the calm, God-like
eyes fastened on him. “Funny,” said George. “I
used to have a hell of a lot of fun with ’im. Used to
play jokes on ’im ’cause he was too dumb to take care
of ’imself. But he was too dumb even to know he had
a joke played on him. I had fun. Made me seem God
damn smart alongside of him. Why he’d do any damn
thing I tol’ him. If I tol’ him to walk over a cliff, over
he’d go. That wasn’t so damn much fun after a while.
He never got mad about it, neither. I’ve beat the hell
outa him, and he coulda bust every bone in my body
jus’ with his han’s, but he never lifted a finger against
me.” George’s voice was taking on the tone of confession.
“Tell you what made me stop that. One day a
bunch of guys was standin’ around up on the Sacramento
River. I was feelin’ pretty smart. I turns to
Lennie and says, ‘Jump in.’ An’ he jumps. Couldn’t
swim a stroke. He damn near drowned before we
could get him. An’ he was so damn nice to me for
pullin’ him out. Clean forgot I told him to jump in.
Well, I ain’t done nothing like that no more.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p371">p371</span>“He’s a nice fella,” said Slim. “Guy don’t need no
sense to be a nice fella. Seems to me sometimes it jus’
works the other way around. Take a real smart guy
and he ain’t hardly ever a nice fella.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p372">p372</span>George stacked the scattered cards and began to
lay out his solitaire hand. The shoes thudded on the
ground outside. At the windows the light of the evening
still made the window squares bright.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p373">p373</span>“I ain’t got no people,” George said. “I seen the
guys that go around on the ranches alone. That ain’t
no good. They don’t have no fun. After a long time
they get mean. They get wantin’ to fight all the time.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p374">p374</span>“Yeah, they get mean,” Slim agreed. “They get so
they don’t want to talk to nobody.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p375">p375</span>“ ’Course Lennie’s a God damn nuisance most of
the time,” said George. “But you get used to goin’
around with a guy an’ you can’t get rid of him.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p376">p376</span>“He ain’t mean,” said Slim. “I can see Lennie ain’t
a bit mean.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p377">p377</span>“ ’Course he ain’t mean. But he gets in trouble alla
time because he’s so God damn dumb. Like what happened
in Weed——” He stopped, stopped in the middle
of turning over a card. He looked alarmed and
peered over at Slim. “You wouldn’t tell nobody?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p378">p378</span>“What’d he do in Weed?” Slim asked calmly.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p379">p379</span>“You wouldn’ tell? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, ’course you wouldn’.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p380">p380</span>“What’d he do in Weed?” Slim asked again.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p381">p381</span>“Well, he seen this girl in a red dress. Dumb bastard
like he is, he wants to touch ever’thing he likes. Just
wants to feel it. So he reaches out to feel this red dress
an’ the girl lets out a squawk, and that gets Lennie
all mixed up, and he holds on ’cause that’s the only
thing he can think to do. Well, this girl squawks and
squawks. I was jus’ a little bit off, and I heard all the
yellin’, so I comes running, an’ by that time Lennie’s
so scared all he can think to do is jus’ hold on. I
socked him over the head with a fence picket to make
him let go. He was so scairt he couldn’t let go of that
dress. And he’s so God damn strong, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p382">p382</span>Slim’s eyes were level and unwinking. He nodded
very slowly. “So what happens?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p383">p383</span>George carefully built his line of solitaire cards.
“Well, that girl rabbits in an’ tells the law she been
raped. The guys in Weed start a party out to lynch
Lennie. So we sit in a irrigation ditch under water all
the rest of that day. Got on’y our heads sticking outa
water, an’ up
under the grass that sticks out
from the side of the ditch. An’ that night we scrammed
outa there.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p384">p384</span>Slim sat in silence for a moment. “Didn’t hurt the
girl none, huh?” he asked finally.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p385">p385</span>“Hell, no. He just scared her. I’d be scared too if
he grabbed me. But he never hurt her. He jus’ wanted
to touch that red dress, like he wants to pet them
pups all the time.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p386">p386</span>“He ain’t mean,” said Slim. “I can tell a mean guy
a mile off.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p387">p387</span>“ ’Course he ain’t, and he’ll do any damn thing I——”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p388">p388</span>Lennie came in through the door. He wore his blue
denim coat over his shoulders like a cape, and he
walked hunched way over.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p389">p389</span>“Hi, Lennie,” said George. “How do you like the
pup now?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p390">p390</span>Lennie said breathlessly, “He’s brown an’ white jus’
like I wanted.” He went directly to his bunk and lay
down and turned his face to the wall and drew up
his knees.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p391">p391</span>George put down his cards very deliberately. “Lennie,”
he said sharply.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p392">p392</span>Lennie twisted his neck and looked over his shoulder.
“Huh? What you want, George?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p393">p393</span>“I tol’ you you couldn’t bring that pup in here.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p394">p394</span>“What pup, George? I ain’t got no pup.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p395">p395</span>George went quickly to him, grabbed him by the
shoulder and rolled him over. He reached down and
picked the tiny puppy from where Lennie had been
concealing it against his stomach.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p396">p396</span>Lennie sat up quickly. “Give ’um to me, George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p397">p397</span>George said, “You get right up an’ take this pup
back to the nest. He’s gotta sleep with his mother.
You want to kill him? Just born last night an’ you
take him out of the nest. You take him back or I’ll tell
Slim not to let you have him.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p398">p398</span>Lennie held out his hands pleadingly. “Give ’um to
me, George. I’ll take ’um back. I didn’t mean no harm,
George. Honest I didn’t. I jus’ wanted to pet ’um a
little.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p399">p399</span>George handed the pup to him. “Awright. You get
him back there quick, and don’ you take him out no
more. You’ll kill him, the first thing you know.” Lennie
fairly scuttled out of the room.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p400">p400</span>Slim had not moved. His calm eyes followed Lennie
out the door. “Jesus,” he said. “He’s jes’ like a
kid, ain’t he.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p401">p401</span>“Sure he’s jes’ like a kid. There ain’t no more harm
in him than a kid neither, except he’s so strong. I bet
he won’t come in here to sleep tonight. He’d sleep
right alongside that box in the barn. Well—let ’im.
He ain’t doin’ no harm out there.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p402">p402</span>It was almost dark outside now. Old Candy, the
swamper, came in and went to his bunk, and behind
him struggled his old dog. “Hello, Slim. Hello,
George. Didn’t neither of you play horseshoes?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p403">p403</span>“I don’t like to play ever’ night,” said Slim.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p404">p404</span>Candy went on, “Either you guys got a slug of
whisky? I gotta gut ache.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p405">p405</span>“I ain’t,” said Slim. “I’d drink it myself if I had, an’
I ain’t got a gut ache neither.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p406">p406</span>“Gotta bad gut ache,” said Candy. “Them God
damn turnips give it to me. I knowed they was going
to before I ever eat ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p407">p407</span>The thick-bodied Carlson came in out of the darkening
yard. He walked to the other end of the bunk
house and turned on the second shaded light. “Darker’n
hell in here,” he said. “Jesus, how that nigger
can pitch shoes.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p408">p408</span>“He’s plenty good,” said Slim.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p409">p409</span>“Damn right he is,” said Carlson. “He don’t give
nobody else a chance to win——” He stopped and
sniffed the air, and still sniffing, looked down at the
old dog. “God awmighty, that dog stinks. Get him
outa here, Candy! I don’t know nothing that stinks
as bad as an old dog. You gotta get him out.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p410">p410</span>Candy rolled to the edge of his bunk. He reached
over and patted the ancient dog, and he apologized,
“I been around him so much I never notice how he
stinks.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p411">p411</span>“Well, I can’t stand him in here,” said Carlson.
“That stink hangs around even after he’s gone.” He
walked over with his heavy-legged stride and looked
down at the dog. “Got no teeth,” he said. “He’s all
stiff with rheumatism. He ain’t no good to you, Candy.
An’ he ain’t no good to himself. Why’n’t you
shoot him, Candy?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p412">p412</span>The old man squirmed uncomfortably. “Well—hell!
I had him so long. Had him since he was a pup.
I herded sheep with him.” He said proudly, “You
wouldn’t think it to look at him now, but he was the
best damn sheep dog I ever seen.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p413">p413</span>George said, “I seen a guy in Weed that had an
Airedale could herd sheep. Learned it from the other
dogs.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p414">p414</span>Carlson was not to be put off. “Look, Candy. This
ol’ dog jus’ suffers hisself all the time. If you was to
take him out and shoot him right in the back of the
head—” he leaned over and pointed, “—right there,
why he’d never know what hit him.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p415">p415</span>Candy looked about unhappily. “No,” he said softly.
“No, I couldn’ do that. I had ’im too long.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p416">p416</span>“He don’t have no fun,” Carlson insisted. “And he
stinks to beat hell. Tell you what. I’ll shoot him for
you. Then it won’t be you that does it.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p417">p417</span>Candy threw his legs off his bunk. He scratched
the white stubble whiskers on his cheek nervously.
“I’m so used to him,” he said softly. “I had him from
a pup.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p418">p418</span>“Well, you ain’t bein’ kind to him keepin’ him
alive,” said Carlson. “Look, Slim’s bitch got a litter
right now. I bet Slim would give you one of them
pups to raise up, wouldn’t you, Slim?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p419">p419</span>The skinner had been studying the old dog with
his calm eyes. “Yeah,” he said. “You can have a pup
if you want to.” He seemed to shake himself free for
speech. “Carl’s right, Candy. That dog ain’t no good
to himself. I wisht somebody’d shoot me if I got old
an’ a cripple.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p420">p420</span>Candy looked helplessly at him, for Slim’s opinions
were law. “Maybe it’d hurt him,” he suggested. “I
don’t mind takin’ care of him.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p421">p421</span>Carlson said, “The way I’d shoot him, he wouldn’t
feel nothing. I’d put the gun right there.” He pointed
with his toe. “Right back of the head. He wouldn’t
even quiver.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p422">p422</span>Candy looked for help from face to face. It was
quite dark outside by now. A young laboring man
came in. His sloping shoulders were bent forward and
he walked heavily on his heels, as though he carried
the invisible grain bag. He went to his bunk and put
his hat on his shelf. Then he picked a pulp magazine
from his shelf and brought it to the light over the
table. “Did I show you this, Slim?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p423">p423</span>“Show me what?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p424">p424</span>The young man turned to the back of the magazine,
put it down on the table and pointed with his
finger. “Right there, read that.” Slim bent over it. “Go
on,” said the young man. “Read it out loud.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p425">p425</span>“ ‘Dear Editor:’ ” Slim read slowly. “ ‘I read your
mag for six years and I think it is the best on the market.
I like stories by Peter Rand. I think he is a
whing-ding. Give us more like the Dark Rider. I don’t
write many letters. Just thought I would tell you I
think your mag is the best dime’s worth I ever spent.’ ”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p426">p426</span>Slim looked up questioningly. “What you want me
to read that for?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p427">p427</span>Whit said, “Go on. Read the name at the bottom.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p428">p428</span>Slim read, “ ‘Yours for success, William Tenner.’ ”
He glanced up at Whit again. “What you want me to
read that for?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p429">p429</span>Whit closed the magazine impressively. “Don’t you
remember Bill Tenner? Worked here about three
months ago?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p430">p430</span>Slim thought.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “Little guy?” he asked. “Drove a
cultivator?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p431">p431</span>“That’s him,” Whit cried. “That’s the guy!”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p432">p432</span>“You think he’s the guy wrote this letter?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p433">p433</span>“I know it. Bill and me was in here one day. Bill
had one of them books that just come. He was lookin’
in it and he says, ‘I wrote a letter. Wonder if they put
it in the book!’ But it wasn’t there. Bill says, ‘Maybe
they’re savin’ it for later.’ An’ that’s just what they
done. There it is.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p434">p434</span>“Guess you’re right,” said Slim. “Got it right in the
book.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p435">p435</span>George held out his hand for the magazine. “Let’s
look at it?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p436">p436</span>Whit found the place again, but he did not surrender
his hold on it. He pointed out the letter with his
forefinger. And then he went to his box shelf and laid
the magazine carefully in. “I wonder if Bill seen it,” he
said. “Bill and me worked in that patch of field peas.
Run cultivators, both of us. Bill was a hell of a nice
fella.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p437">p437</span>During the conversation Carlson had refused to be
drawn in. He continued to look down at the old dog.
Candy watched him uneasily. At last Carlson said, “If
you want me to, I’ll put the old devil out of his misery
right now and get it over with. Ain’t nothing left for
him. Can’t eat, can’t see, can’t even walk without
hurtin’.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p438">p438</span>Candy said hopefully, “You ain’t got no gun.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p439">p439</span>“The hell I ain’t. Got a Luger. It won’t hurt him
none at all.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p440">p440</span>Candy said, “Maybe tomorra. Le’s wait till tomorra.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p441">p441</span>“I don’t see no reason for it,” said Carlson. He went
to his bunk, pulled his bag from underneath it and took
out a Luger pistol. “Let’s get it over with,” he said.
“We can’t sleep with him stinkin’ around in here.” He
put the pistol in his hip pocket.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p442">p442</span>Candy looked a long time at Slim to try to find some
reversal. And Slim gave him none. At last Candy said
softly and hopelessly, “Awright—take ’im.” He did
not look down at the dog at all. He lay back on his
bunk and crossed his arms behind his head and stared
at the ceiling.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p443">p443</span>From his pocket Carlson took a little leather thong.
He stooped over and tied it around the old dog’s neck.
All the men except Candy watched him. “Come boy.
Come on, boy,” he said gently. And he said apologetically
to Candy, “He won’t even feel it.” Candy did
not move nor answer him. He twitched the thong.
“Come on, boy.” The old dog got slowly and stiffly to
his feet and followed the gently pulling leash.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p444">p444</span>Slim said, “Carlson.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p445">p445</span>“Yeah?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p446">p446</span>“You know what to do.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p447">p447</span>“What ya mean, Slim?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p448">p448</span>“Take a shovel,” said Slim shortly.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p449">p449</span>“Oh, sure! I get you.” He led the dog out into the
darkness.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p450">p450</span>George followed to the door and shut the door and
set the latch gently in its place. Candy lay rigidly on
his bed staring at the ceiling.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p451">p451</span>Slim said loudly, “One of my lead mules got a bad
hoof. Got to get some tar on it.” His voice trailed off.
It was silent outside. Carlson’s footsteps died away.
The silence came into the room. And the silence lasted.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p452">p452</span>George chuckled, “I bet Lennie’s right out there in
the barn with his pup. He won’t want to come in here
no more now he’s got a pup.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p453">p453</span>Slim said, “Candy, you can have any one of them
pups you want.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p454">p454</span>Candy did not answer. The silence fell on the room
again. It came out of the night and invaded the room.
George said, “Anybody like to play a little euchre?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p455">p455</span>“I’ll play out a few with you,” said Whit.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p456">p456</span>They took places opposite each other at the table
under the light, but George did not shuffle the cards.
He rippled the edge of the deck nervously, and the
little snapping noise drew the eyes of all the men in the
room, so that he stopped doing it. The silence fell on
the room again. A minute passed, and another minute.
Candy lay still, staring at the ceiling. Slim gazed at
him for a moment and then looked down at his hands;
he subdued one hand with the other, and held it down.
There came a little gnawing sound from under the
floor and all the men looked down toward it gratefully.
Only Candy continued to stare at the ceiling.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p457">p457</span>“Sounds like there was a rat under there,” said
George. “We ought to get a trap down there.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p458">p458</span>Whit broke out, “What the hell’s takin’ him so
long? Lay out some cards, why don’t you? We ain’t
going to get no euchre played this way.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p459">p459</span>George brought the cards together tightly and
studied the backs of them. The silence was in the room
again.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p460">p460</span>A shot sounded in the distance. The men looked
quickly at the old man. Every head turned toward him.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p461">p461</span>For a moment he continued to stare at the ceiling.
Then he rolled slowly over and faced the wall and lay
silent.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p462">p462</span>George shuffled the cards noisily and dealt them.
Whit drew a scoring board to him and set the pegs to
start. Whit said, “I guess you guys really come here
to work.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p463">p463</span>“How do ya mean?” George asked.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p464">p464</span>Whit laughed. “Well, ya come on a Friday. You
got two days to work till Sunday.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p465">p465</span>“I don’t see how you figure,” said George.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p466">p466</span>Whit laughed again. “You do if you been around
these big ranches much. Guy that wants to look over
a ranch comes in Sat’day afternoon. He gets Sat’day
night supper an’ three meals on Sunday, and he can
quit Monday mornin’ after breakfast without turning
his hand. But you come to work Friday noon. You got
to put in a day an’ a half no matter how you figure.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p467">p467</span>George looked at him levelly. “We’re gonna stick
aroun’ a while,” he said. “Me an’ Lennie’s gonna roll
up a stake.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p468">p468</span>The door opened quietly and the stable buck put in
his head; a lean negro head, lined with pain, the eyes
patient. “Mr. Slim.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p469">p469</span>Slim took his eyes from old Candy. “Huh? Oh!
Hello, Crooks. What’s’a matter?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p470">p470</span>“You told me to warm up tar for that mule’s foot.
I got it warm.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p471">p471</span>“Oh! Sure, Crooks. I’ll come right out an’ put it on.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p472">p472</span>“I can do it if you want, Mr. Slim.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p473">p473</span>“No. I’ll come do it myself.” He stood up.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p474">p474</span>Crooks said, “Mr. Slim.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p475">p475</span>“Yeah.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p476">p476</span>“That big new guy’s messin’ around your pups out
in the barn.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p477">p477</span>“Well, he ain’t doin’ no harm. I give him one of
them pups.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p478">p478</span>“Just thought I’d tell ya,” said Crooks. “He’s takin’
’em outa the nest and handlin’ them. That won’t do
them no good.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p479">p479</span>“He won’t hurt ’em,” said Slim. “I’ll come along
with you now.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p480">p480</span>George looked up. “If that crazy bastard’s foolin’
around too much, jus’ kick him out, Slim.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p481">p481</span>Slim followed the stable buck out of the room.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p482">p482</span>George dealt and Whit picked up his cards and examined
them. “Seen the new kid yet?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p483">p483</span>“What kid?” George asked.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p484">p484</span>“Why, Curley’s new wife.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p485">p485</span>“Yeah, I seen her.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p486">p486</span>“Well, ain’t she a looloo?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p487">p487</span>“I ain’t seen that much of her,” said George.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p488">p488</span>Whit laid down his cards impressively. “Well, stick
around an’ keep your eyes open. You’ll see plenty. She
ain’t concealin’ nothing. I never seen nobody like her.
She got the eye goin’ all the time on everybody. I bet
she even gives the stable buck the eye. I don’t know
what the hell she wants.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p489">p489</span>George asked casually, “Been any trouble since she
got here?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p490">p490</span>It was obvious that Whit was not interested in his
cards. He laid his hand down and George scooped it
in. George laid out his deliberate solitaire hand—seven
cards, and six on top, and five on top of those.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p491">p491</span>Whit said, “I see what you mean. No, they ain’t
been nothing yet. Curley’s got yella-jackets in his
drawers, but that’s all so far. Ever’ time the guys is
around she shows up. She’s lookin’ for Curley, or she
thought she lef’ somethin’ layin’ around and she’s
lookin’ for it. Seems like she can’t keep away from
guys. An’ Curley’s pants is just crawlin’ with ants, but
they ain’t nothing come of it yet.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p492">p492</span>George said, “She’s gonna make a mess. They’s
gonna be a bad mess about her. She’s a jail bait all set
on the trigger. That Curley got his work cut out for
him. Ranch with a bunch of guys on it ain’t no place
for a girl, specially like her.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p493">p493</span>Whit said, “If you got idears, you ought ta come in
town with us guys tomorra night.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p494">p494</span>“Why? What’s doin’?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p495">p495</span>“Jus’ the usual thing. We go in to old Susy’s place.
Hell of a nice place. Old Susy’s a laugh—always
crackin’ jokes. Like she says when we come up on the
front porch las’ Sat’day night. Susy opens the door and
then she yells over her shoulder, ‘Get yor coats on,
girls, here comes the sheriff.’ She never talks dirty,
neither. Got five girls there.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p496">p496</span>“What’s it set you back?” George asked.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p497">p497</span>“Two an’ a half. You can get a shot for two bits.
Susy got nice chairs to set in, too. If a guy don’t want
a flop, why he can just set in the chairs and have a
couple or three shots and pass the time of day and
Susy don’t give a damn. She ain’t rushin’ guys through
and kickin’ ’em out if they don’t want a flop.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p498">p498</span>“Might go in and look the joint over,” said George.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p499">p499</span>“Sure. Come along. It’s a hell of a lot of fun—her
crackin’ jokes all the time. Like she says one time, she
says, ‘I’ve knew people that if they got a rag rug on
the floor an’ a kewpie doll lamp on the phonograph
they think they’re running a parlor house.’ That’s
Clara’s house she’s talkin’ about. An’ Susy says, ‘I
know what you boys want,’ she says. ‘My girls is
clean,’ she says, ‘an’ there ain’t no water in my
whisky,’ she says. ‘If any you guys wanta look at a
kewpie doll lamp an’ take your own chance gettin’
burned, why you know where to go.’ An’ she says,
‘There’s guys around here walkin’ bow-legged ’cause
they like to look at a kewpie doll lamp.’ ”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p500">p500</span>George asked, “Clara runs the other house, huh?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p501">p501</span>“Yeah,” said Whit. “We don’t never go there. Clara
gets three bucks a crack and thirty-five cents a shot,
and she don’t crack no jokes. But Susy’s place is clean
and she got nice chairs. Don’t let no goo-goos in,
neither.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p502">p502</span>“Me an’ Lennie’s rollin’ up a stake,” said George.
“I might go in an’ set and have a shot, but I ain’t puttin’
out no two and a half.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p503">p503</span>“Well, a guy got to have some fun sometime,” said
Whit.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p504">p504</span>The door opened and Lennie and Carlson came in
together. Lennie crept to his bunk and sat down, trying
not to attract attention. Carlson reached under his
bunk and brought out his bag. He didn’t look at old
Candy, who still faced the wall. Carlson found a little
cleaning rod in the bag and a can of oil. He laid them
on his bed and then brought out the pistol, took out
the magazine and snapped the loaded shell from the
chamber. Then he fell to cleaning the barrel with the
little rod. When the ejector snapped, Candy turned
over and looked for a moment at the gun before he
turned back to the wall again.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p505">p505</span>Carlson said casually, “Curley been in yet?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p506">p506</span>“No,” said Whit. “What’s eatin’ on Curley?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p507">p507</span>Carlson squinted down the barrel of his gun.
“Lookin’ for his old lady. I seen him going round and
round outside.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p508">p508</span>Whit said sarcastically, “He spends half his time
lookin’ for her, and the rest of the time she’s lookin’
for him.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p509">p509</span>Curley burst into the room excitedly. “Any you
guys seen my wife?” he demanded.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p510">p510</span>“She ain’t been here,” said Whit.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p511">p511</span>Curley looked threateningly about the room. “Where
the hell’s Slim?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p512">p512</span>“Went out in the barn,” said George. “He was
gonna put some tar on a split hoof.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p513">p513</span>Curley’s shoulders dropped and squared. “How long
ago’d he go?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p514">p514</span>“Five—ten minutes.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p515">p515</span>Curley jumped out the door and banged it after him.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p516">p516</span>Whit stood up. “I guess maybe I’d like to see this,”
he said. “Curley’s just spoilin’ or he wouldn’t start for
Slim. An’ Curley’s handy, God damn handy. Got in
the finals for the Golden Gloves. He got newspaper
clippings about it.” He considered. “But jus’ the same,
he better leave Slim alone. Nobody don’t know what
Slim can do.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p517">p517</span>“Thinks Slim’s with his wife, don’t he?” said George.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p518">p518</span>“Looks like it,” Whit said. “ ’Course Slim ain’t.
Least I don’t think Slim is. But I like to see the fuss if
it comes off. Come on, le’s go.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p519">p519</span>George said, “I’m stayin’ right here. I don’t want to
get mixed up in nothing. Lennie and me got to make
a stake.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p520">p520</span>Carlson finished the cleaning of the gun and put it in
the bag and pushed the bag under his bunk. “I guess
I’ll go out and look her over,” he said. Old Candy lay
still, and Lennie, from his bunk, watched George
cautiously.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p521">p521</span>When Whit and Carlson were gone and the door
closed after them, George turned to Lennie. “What
you got on your mind?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p522">p522</span>“I ain’t done nothing, George. Slim says I better not
pet them pups so much for a while. Slim says it ain’t
good for them; so I come right in. I been good, George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p523">p523</span>“I coulda told you that,” said George.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p524">p524</span>“Well, I wasn’t hurtin’ ’em none. I jus’ had mine in
my lap pettin’ it.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p525">p525</span>George asked, “Did you see Slim out in the barn?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p526">p526</span>“Sure I did. He tol’ me I better not pet that pup no
more.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p527">p527</span>“Did you see that girl?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p528">p528</span>“You mean Curley’s girl?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p529">p529</span>“Yeah. Did she come in the barn?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p530">p530</span>“No. Anyways I never seen her.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p531">p531</span>“You never seen Slim talkin’ to her?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p532">p532</span>“Uh-uh. She ain’t been in the barn.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p533">p533</span>“O.K.,” said George. “I guess them guys ain’t gonna
see no fight. If there’s any fightin’, Lennie, you keep
out of it.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p534">p534</span>“I don’t want no fights,” said Lennie. He got up
from his bunk and sat down at the table, across from
George. Almost automatically George shuffled the
cards and laid out his solitaire hand. He used a deliberate,
thoughtful, slowness.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p535">p535</span>Lennie reached for a face card and studied it, then
turned it upside down and studied it. “Both ends the
same,” he said. “George, why is it both end’s the same?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p536">p536</span>“I don’t know,” said George. “That’s jus’ the way
they make ’em. What was Slim doin’ in the barn when
you seen him?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p537">p537</span>“Slim?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p538">p538</span>“Sure. You seen him in the barn, an’ he tol’ you not
to pet the pups so much.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p539">p539</span>“Oh, yeah. He had a can a’ tar an’ a paint brush. I
don’t know what for.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p540">p540</span>“You sure that girl didn’t come in like she come in
here today?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p541">p541</span>“No. She never come.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p542">p542</span>George sighed. “You give me a good whore house
every time,” he said. “A guy can go in an’ get drunk
and get ever’thing outa his system all at once, an’ no
messes. And he knows how much it’s gonna set him
back. These here jail baits is just set on the trigger of
the hoosegow.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p543">p543</span>Lennie followed his words admiringly, and moved
his lips a little to keep up. George continued, “You
remember Andy Cushman, Lennie? Went to grammar
school?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p544">p544</span>“The one that his old lady used to make hot cakes
for the kids?” Lennie asked.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p545">p545</span>“Yeah. That’s the one. You can remember anything
if there’s anything to eat in it.” George looked carefully
at the solitaire hand. He put an ace up on his
scoring rack and piled a two, three and four of diamonds
on it. “Andy’s in San Quentin right now on
account of a tart,” said George.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p546">p546</span>Lennie drummed on the table with his fingers.
“George?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p547">p547</span>“Huh?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p548">p548</span>“George, how long’s it gonna be till we get that
little place an’ live on the fatta the lan’—an’ rabbits?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p549">p549</span>“I don’ know,” said George. “We gotta get a big
stake together. I know a little place we can get cheap,
but they ain’t givin’ it away.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p550">p550</span>Old Candy turned slowly over. His eyes were wide
open. He watched George carefully.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p551">p551</span>Lennie said, “Tell about that place, George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p552">p552</span>“I jus’ tol’ you, jus’ las’ night.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p553">p553</span>“Go on—tell again, George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p554">p554</span>“Well, it’s ten acres,” said George. “Got a little
win’mill. Got a little shack on it, an’ a chicken run.
Got a kitchen, orchard, cherries, apples, peaches, ’cots,
nuts, got a few berries. They’s a place for alfalfa and
plenty water to flood it. They’s a pig pen——”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p555">p555</span>“An’ rabbits, George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p556">p556</span>“No place for rabbits now, but I could easy build a
few hutches and you could feed alfalfa to the rabbits.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p557">p557</span>“Damn right, I could,” said Lennie. “You God
damn right I could.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p558">p558</span>George’s hands stopped working with the cards. His
voice was growing warmer. “An’ we could have a few
pigs. I could build a smoke house like the one gran’pa
had, an’ when we kill a pig we can smoke the bacon
and the hams, and make sausage an’ all like that. An’
when the salmon run up river we could catch a hundred
of ’em an’ salt ’em down or smoke ’em. We
could have them for breakfast. They ain’t nothing so
nice as smoked salmon. When the fruit come in we
could can it—and tomatoes, they’re easy to can. Ever’
Sunday we’d kill a chicken or a rabbit. Maybe we’d
have a cow or a goat, and the cream is so God damn
thick you got to cut it with a knife and take it out
with a spoon.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p559">p559</span>Lennie watched him with wide eyes, and old Candy
watched him too. Lennie said softly, “We could live
offa the fatta the lan’.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p560">p560</span>“Sure,” said George. “All kin’s a vegetables in the
garden, and if we want a little whisky we can sell a
few eggs or something, or some milk. We’d jus’ live
there. We’d belong there. There wouldn’t be no more
runnin’ round the country and gettin’ fed by a Jap
cook. No, sir, we’d have our own place where we
belonged and not sleep in no bunk house.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p561">p561</span>“Tell about the house, George,” Lennie begged.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p562">p562</span>“Sure, we’d have a little house an’ a room to ourself.
Little fat iron stove, an’ in the winter we’d keep a fire
goin’ in it. It ain’t enough land so we’d have to work
too hard. Maybe six, seven hours a day. We wouldn’t
have to buck no barley eleven hours a day. An’ when
we put in a crop, why, we’d be there to take the crop
up. We’d know what come of our planting.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p563">p563</span>“An’ rabbits,” Lennie said eagerly. “An’ I’d take
care of ’em. Tell how I’d do that, George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p564">p564</span>“Sure, you’d go out in the alfalfa patch an’ you’d
have a sack. You’d fill up the sack and bring it in an’
put it in the rabbit cages.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p565">p565</span>“They’d nibble an’ they’d nibble,” said Lennie, “the
way they do. I seen ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p566">p566</span>“Ever’ six weeks or so,” George continued, “them
does would throw a litter so we’d have plenty rabbits
to eat an’ to sell. An’ we’d keep a few pigeons to go
flyin’ around the win’mill like they done when I was
a kid.” He looked raptly at the wall over Lennie’s
head. “An’ it’d be our own, an’ nobody could can us.
If we don’t like a guy we can say, ‘Get the hell out,’
and by God he’s got to do it. An’ if a fren’ come
along, why we’d have an extra bunk, an’ we’d say,
‘Why don’t you spen’ the night?’ an’ by God he
would. We’d have a setter dog and a couple stripe cats,
but you gotta watch out them cats don’t get the little
rabbits.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p567">p567</span>Lennie breathed hard. “You jus’ let ’em try to get
the rabbits. I’ll break their God damn necks. I’ll .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I’ll smash ’em with a stick.” He subsided, grumbling
to himself, threatening the future cats which might
dare to disturb the future rabbits.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p568">p568</span>George sat entranced with his own picture.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p569">p569</span>When Candy spoke they both jumped as though
they had been caught doing something reprehensible.
Candy said, “You know where’s a place like that?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p570">p570</span>George was on guard immediately. “S’pose I do,” he
said. “What’s that to you?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p571">p571</span>“You don’t need to tell me where it’s at. Might be
any place.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p572">p572</span>“Sure,” said George. “That’s right. You couldn’t
find it in a hundred years.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p573">p573</span>Candy went on excitedly, “How much they want
for a place like that?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p574">p574</span>George watched him suspiciously. “Well—I could
get it for six hundred bucks. The ol’ people that owns
it is flat bust an’ the ol’ lady needs an operation. Say—what’s
it to you? You got nothing to do with us.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p575">p575</span>Candy said, “I ain’t much good with on’y one hand.
I lost my hand right here on this ranch. That’s why
they give me a job swampin’. An’ they give me two
hunderd an’ fifty dollars ’cause I los’ my hand. An’ I
got fifty more saved up right in the bank, right now.
Tha’s three hunderd, and I got fifty more comin’ the
end a the month. Tell you what—” He leaned forward
eagerly. “S’pose I went in with you guys. Tha’s
three hunderd an’ fifty bucks I’d put in. I ain’t much
good, but I could cook and tend the chickens and hoe
the garden some. How’d that be?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p576">p576</span>George half-closed his eyes. “I gotta think about
that. We was always gonna do it by ourselves.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p577">p577</span>Candy interrupted him, “I’d make a will an’ leave
my share to you guys in case I kick off, ’cause I ain’t
got no relatives nor nothing. You guys got any money?
Maybe we could do her right now?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p578">p578</span>George spat on the floor disgustedly. “We got ten
bucks between us.” Then he said thoughtfully, “Look,
if me an’ Lennie work a month an’ don’t spen’ nothing,
we’ll have a hunderd bucks. That’d be four fifty.
I bet we could swing her for that. Then you an’ Lennie
could go get her started an’ I’d get a job an’ make
up the res’, an’ you could sell eggs an’ stuff like that.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p579">p579</span>They fell into a silence. They looked at one another,
amazed. This thing they had never really believed in
was coming true. George said reverently, “Jesus Christ!
I bet we could swing her.” His eyes were full of wonder.
“I bet we could swing her,” he repeated softly.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p580">p580</span>Candy sat on the edge of his bunk. He scratched the
stump of his wrist nervously. “I got hurt four years
ago,” he said. “They’ll can me purty soon. Jus’ as soon
as I can’t swamp out no bunk houses they’ll put me on
the county. Maybe if I give you guys my money,
you’ll let me hoe in the garden even after I ain’t no
good at it. An’ I’ll wash dishes an’ little chicken stuff
like that. But I’ll be on our own place, an’ I’ll be let to
work on our own place.” He said miserably, “You seen
what they done to my dog tonight? They says he
wasn’t no good to himself nor nobody else. When they
can me here I wisht somebody’d shoot me. But they
won’t do nothing like that. I won’t have no place to
go, an’ I can’t get no more jobs. I’ll have thirty dollars
more comin’, time you guys is ready to quit.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p581">p581</span>George stood up. “We’ll do her,” he said. “We’ll
fix up that little old place an’ we’ll go live there.” He
sat down again. They all sat still, all bemused by the
beauty of the thing, each mind was popped into the
future when this lovely thing should come about.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p582">p582</span>George said wonderingly, “S’pose they was a carnival
or a circus come to town, or a ball game, or any
damn thing.” Old Candy nodded in appreciation of
the idea. “We’d just go to her,” George said. “We
wouldn’t ask nobody if we could. Jus’ say, ‘We’ll go
to her,’ an’ we would. Jus’ milk the cow and sling
some grain to the chickens an’ go to her.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p583">p583</span>“An’ put some grass to the rabbits,” Lennie broke
in. “I wouldn’t never forget to feed them. When we
gon’ta do it, George?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p584">p584</span>“In one month. Right squack in one month. Know
what I’m gon’ta do? I’m gon’ta write to them old people
that owns the place that we’ll take it. An’ Candy’ll
send a hunderd dollars to bind her.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p585">p585</span>“Sure will,” said Candy. “They got a good stove
there?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p586">p586</span>“Sure, got a nice stove, burns coal or wood.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p587">p587</span>“I’m gonna take my pup,” said Lennie. “I bet by
Christ he likes it there, by Jesus.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p588">p588</span>Voices were approaching from outside. George said
quickly, “Don’t tell nobody about it. Jus’ us three an’
nobody else. They li’ble to can us so we can’t make
no stake. Jus’ go on like we was gonna buck barley the
rest of our lives, then all of a sudden some day we’ll
go get our pay an’ scram outa here.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p589">p589</span>Lennie and Candy nodded, and they were grinning
with delight. “Don’t tell nobody,” Lennie said to himself.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p590">p590</span>Candy said, “George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p591">p591</span>“Huh?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p592">p592</span>“I ought to of shot that dog myself, George. I
shouldn’t ought to of let no stranger shoot my dog.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p593">p593</span>The door opened. Slim came in, followed by Curley
and Carlson and Whit. Slim’s hands were black with
tar and he was scowling. Curley hung close to his
elbow.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p594">p594</span>Curley said, “Well, I didn’t mean nothing, Slim. I
just ast you.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p595">p595</span>Slim said, “Well, you been askin’ me too often. I’m
gettin’ God damn sick of it. If you can’t look after
your own God damn wife, what you expect me to do
about it? You lay offa me.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p596">p596</span>“I’m jus’ tryin’ to tell you I didn’t mean nothing,”
said Curley. “I jus’ thought you might of saw her.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p597">p597</span>“Why’n’t you tell her to stay the hell home where
she belongs?” said Carlson. “You let her hang around
bunk houses and pretty soon you’re gonna have
som’pin on your hands and you won’t be able to do
nothing about it.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p598">p598</span>Curley whirled on Carlson. “You keep outta this les’
you wanta step outside.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p599">p599</span>Carlson laughed. “You God damn punk,” he said.
“You tried to throw a scare into Slim, an’ you couldn’t
make it stick. Slim throwed a scare inta you. You’re
yella as a frog belly. I don’t care if you’re the best
welter in the country. You come for me, an’ I’ll kick
your God damn head off.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p600">p600</span>Candy joined the attack with joy. “Glove fulla
vaseline,” he said disgustedly. Curley glared at him.
His eyes slipped on past and lighted on Lennie; and
Lennie was still smiling with delight at the memory of
the ranch.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p601">p601</span>Curley stepped over to Lennie like a terrier. “What
the hell you laughin’ at?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p602">p602</span>Lennie looked blankly at him. “Huh?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p603">p603</span>Then Curley’s rage exploded. “Come on, ya big
bastard. Get up on your feet. No big son-of-a-bitch
is gonna laugh at me. I’ll show ya who’s yella.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p604">p604</span>Lennie looked helplessly at George, and then he got
up and tried to retreat. Curley was balanced and
poised. He slashed at Lennie with his left, and then
smashed down his nose with a right. Lennie gave a cry
of terror. Blood welled from his nose. “George,” he
cried. “Make ’um let me alone, George.” He backed
until he was against the wall, and Curley followed,
slugging him in the face. Lennie’s hands remained at
his sides; he was too frightened to defend himself.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p605">p605</span>George was on his feet yelling, “Get him, Lennie.
Don’t let him do it.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p606">p606</span>Lennie covered his face with his huge paws and
bleated with terror. He cried, “Make ’um stop,
George.” Then Curley attacked his stomach and cut
off his wind.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p607">p607</span>Slim jumped up. “The dirty little rat,” he cried, “I’ll
get ’um myself.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p608">p608</span>George put out his hand and grabbed Slim. “Wait
a minute,” he shouted. He cupped his hands around
his mouth and yelled, “Get ’im, Lennie!”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p609">p609</span>Lennie took his hands away from his face and
looked about for George, and Curley slashed at his
eyes. The big face was covered with blood. George
yelled again, “I said get him.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p610">p610</span>Curley’s fist was swinging when Lennie reached for
it. The next minute Curley was flopping like a fish on
a line, and his closed fist was lost in Lennie’s big hand.
George ran down the room. “Leggo of him, Lennie.
Let go.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p611">p611</span>But Lennie watched in terror the flopping little man
whom he held. Blood ran down Lennie’s face, one of
his eyes was cut and closed. George slapped him in the
face again and again, and still Lennie held on to the
closed fist. Curley was white and shrunken by now,
and his struggling had become weak. He stood crying,
his fist lost in Lennie’s paw.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p612">p612</span>George shouted over and over, “Leggo his hand,
Lennie. Leggo. Slim, come help me while the guy got
any hand left.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p613">p613</span>Suddenly Lennie let go his hold. He crouched cowering
against the wall. “You tol’ me to, George,” he
said miserably.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p614">p614</span>Curley sat down on the floor, looking in wonder at
his crushed hand. Slim and Carlson bent over him.
Then Slim straightened up and regarded Lennie with
horror. “We got to get him in to a doctor,” he said.
“Looks to me like ever’ bone in his han’ is bust.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p615">p615</span>“I didn’t wanta,” Lennie cried. “I didn’t wanta hurt
him.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p616">p616</span>Slim said, “Carlson, you get the candy wagon
hitched up. We’ll take ’um into Soledad an’ get ’um
fixed up.” Carlson hurried out. Slim turned to the
whimpering Lennie. “It ain’t your fault,” he said.
“This punk sure had it comin’ to him. But—Jesus!
He ain’t hardly got no han’ left.” Slim hurried out,
and in a moment returned with a tin cup of water. He
held it to Curley’s lips.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p617">p617</span>George said, “Slim, will we get canned now? We
need the stake. Will Curley’s old man can us now?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p618">p618</span>Slim smiled wryly. He knelt down beside Curley.
“You got your senses in hand enough to listen?” he
asked. Curley nodded. “Well, then listen,” Slim went
on. “I think you got your han’ caught in a machine. If
you don’t tell nobody what happened, we ain’t going
to. But you jus’ tell an’ try to get this guy canned and
we’ll tell ever’body, an’ then will you get the laugh.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p619">p619</span>“I won’t tell,” said Curley. He avoided looking at
Lennie.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p620">p620</span>Buggy wheels sounded outside. Slim helped Curley
up. “Come on now. Carlson’s gonna take you to a
doctor.” He helped Curley out the door. The sound
of wheels drew away. In a moment Slim came back
into the bunk house. He looked at Lennie, still crouched
fearfully against the wall. “Le’s see your hands,” he
asked.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p621">p621</span>Lennie stuck out his hands.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p622">p622</span>“Christ awmighty, I hate to have you mad at me,”
Slim said.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p623">p623</span>George broke in, “Lennie was jus’ scairt,” he explained.
“He didn’t know what to do. I told you nobody
ought never to fight him. No, I guess it was
Candy I told.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p624">p624</span>Candy nodded solemnly. “That’s jus’ what you
done,” he said. “Right this morning when Curley first
lit intil your fren’, you says, ‘He better not fool with
Lennie if he knows what’s good for ’um.’ That’s jus’
what you says to me.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p625">p625</span>George turned to Lennie. “It ain’t your fault,” he
said. “You don’t need to be scairt no more. You done
jus’ what I tol’ you to. Maybe you better go in the
wash room an’ clean up your face. You look like hell.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p626">p626</span>Lennie smiled with his bruised mouth. “I didn’t want
no trouble,” he said. He walked toward the door, but
just before he came to it, he turned back. “George?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p627">p627</span>“What you want?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p628">p628</span>“I can still tend the rabbits, George?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p629">p629</span>“Sure. You ain’t done nothing wrong.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p630">p630</span>“I di’n’t mean no harm, George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p631">p631</span>“Well, get the hell out and wash your face.”</p>

<div><h1 id="4">4</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="counter" id="p632">p632</span><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">C</span>rooks,</span> the negro stable buck, had his bunk
in the harness room; a little shed that leaned off the
wall of the barn. On one side of the little room there
was a square four-paned window, and on the other, a
narrow plank door leading into the barn. Crooks’ bunk
was a long box filled with straw, on which his blankets
were flung. On the wall by the window there were
pegs on which hung broken harness in process of being
mended; strips of new leather; and under the window
itself a little bench for leather-working tools, curved
knives and needles and balls of linen thread, and a
small hand riveter. On pegs were also pieces of harness,
a split collar with the horsehair stuffing sticking out, a
broken hame, and a trace chain with its leather covering
split. Crooks had his apple box over his bunk, and
in it a range of medicine bottles, both for himself and
for the horses. There were cans of saddle soap and a
drippy can of tar with its paint brush sticking over the
edge. And scattered about the floor were a number of
personal possessions; for, being alone, Crooks could
leave his things about, and being a stable buck and a
cripple, he was more permanent than the other men,
and he had accumulated more possessions than he
could carry on his back.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p633">p633</span>Crooks possessed several pairs of shoes, a pair of
rubber boots, a big alarm clock and a single-barreled
shotgun. And he had books, too; a tattered dictionary
and a mauled copy of the California civil code for
1905. There were battered magazines and a few dirty
books on a special shelf over his bunk. A pair of large
gold-rimmed spectacles hung from a nail on the wall
above his bed.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p634">p634</span>This room was swept and fairly neat, for Crooks
was a proud, aloof man. He kept his distance and demanded
that other people keep theirs. His body was
bent over to the left by his crooked spine, and his eyes
lay deep in his head, and because of their depth seemed
to glitter with intensity. His lean face was lined with
deep black wrinkles, and he had thin, pain-tightened
lips which were lighter than his face.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p635">p635</span>It was Saturday night. Through the open door that
led into the barn came the sound of moving horses, of
feet stirring, of teeth champing on hay, of the rattle of
halter chains. In the stable buck’s room a small electric
globe threw a meager yellow light.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p636">p636</span>Crooks sat on his bunk. His shirt was out of his jeans
in back. In one hand he held a bottle of liniment, and
with the other he rubbed his spine. Now and then he
poured a few drops of the liniment into his pink-palmed
hand and reached up under his shirt to rub
again. He flexed his muscles against his back and
shivered.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p637">p637</span>Noiselessly Lennie appeared in the open doorway
and stood there looking in, his big shoulders nearly
filling the opening. For a moment Crooks did not see
him, but on raising his eyes he stiffened and a scowl
came on his face. His hand came out from under his
shirt.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p638">p638</span>Lennie smiled helplessly in an attempt to make
friends.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p639">p639</span>Crooks said sharply, “You got no right to come in
my room. This here’s my room. Nobody got any right
in here but me.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p640">p640</span>Lennie gulped and his smile grew more fawning. “I
ain’t doing nothing,” he said. “Just come to look at
my puppy. And I seen your light,” he explained.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p641">p641</span>“Well, I got a right to have a light. You go on get
outta my room. I ain’t wanted in the bunk house, and
you ain’t wanted in my room.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p642">p642</span>“Why ain’t you wanted?” Lennie asked.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p643">p643</span>“ ’Cause I’m black. They play cards in there, but I
can’t play because I’m black. They say I stink. Well,
I tell you, you all of you stink to me.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p644">p644</span>Lennie flapped his big hands helplessly. “Ever’body
went into town,” he said. “Slim an’ George an’ ever’body.
George says I gotta stay here an’ not get in no
trouble. I seen your light.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p645">p645</span>“Well, what do you want?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p646">p646</span>“Nothing—I seen your light. I thought I could jus’
come in an’ set.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p647">p647</span>Crooks stared at Lennie, and he reached behind him
and took down the spectacles and adjusted them over
his pink ears and stared again. “I don’t know what
you’re doin’ in the barn anyway,” he complained.
“You ain’t no skinner. They’s no call for a bucker to
come into the barn at all. You ain’t no skinner. You
ain’t got nothing to do with the horses.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p648">p648</span>“The pup,” Lennie repeated. “I come to see my
pup.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p649">p649</span>“Well, go see your pup, then. Don’t come in a place
where you’re not wanted.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p650">p650</span>Lennie lost his smile. He advanced a step into the
room, then remembered and backed to the door again.
“I looked at ’em a little. Slim says I ain’t to pet ’em
very much.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p651">p651</span>Crooks said, “Well, you been takin’ ’em out of the
nest all the time. I wonder the old lady don’t move ’em
someplace else.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p652">p652</span>“Oh, she don’t care. She lets me.” Lennie had moved
into the room again.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p653">p653</span>Crooks scowled, but Lennie’s disarming smile defeated
him. “Come on in and set a while,” Crooks said.
“ ’Long as you won’t get out and leave me alone, you
might as well set down.” His tone was a little more
friendly. “All the boys gone into town, huh?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p654">p654</span>“All but old Candy. He just sets in the bunk house
sharpening his pencil and sharpening and figuring.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p655">p655</span>Crooks adjusted his glasses. “Figuring? What’s
Candy figuring about?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p656">p656</span>Lennie almost shouted, “ ’Bout the rabbits.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p657">p657</span>“You’re nuts,” said Crooks. “You’re crazy as a
wedge. What rabbits you talkin’ about?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p658">p658</span>“The rabbits we’re gonna get, and I get to tend ’em,
cut grass an’ give ’em water, an’ like that.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p659">p659</span>“Jus’ nuts,” said Crooks. “I don’t blame the guy you
travel with for keepin’ you outa sight.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p660">p660</span>Lennie said quietly, “It ain’t no lie. We’re gonna do
it. Gonna get a little place an’ live on the fatta the
lan’.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p661">p661</span>Crooks settled himself more comfortably on his
bunk. “Set down,” he invited. “Set down on the nail
keg.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p662">p662</span>Lennie hunched down on the little barrel. “You
think it’s a lie,” Lennie said, “But it ain’t no lie. Ever’
word’s the truth, an’ you can ast George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p663">p663</span>Crooks put his dark chin into his pink palm. “You
travel aroun’ with George, don’t ya?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p664">p664</span>“Sure. Me an’ him goes ever’ place together.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p665">p665</span>Crooks continued. “Sometimes he talks, and you
don’t know what the hell he’s talkin’ about. Ain’t that
so?” He leaned forward, boring Lennie with his deep
eyes. “Ain’t that so?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p666">p666</span>“Yeah .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sometimes.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p667">p667</span>“Jus’ talks on, an’ you don’t know what the hell it’s
all about?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p668">p668</span>“Yeah .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sometimes. But .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not always.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p669">p669</span>Crooks leaned forward over the edge of the bunk.
“I ain’t a southern negro,” he said. “I was born right
here in California. My old man had a chicken ranch,
’bout ten acres. The white kids come to play at our
place, an’ sometimes I went to play with them, and
some of them was pretty nice. My ol’ man didn’t like
that. I never knew till long later why he didn’t like
that. But I know now.” He hesitated, and when he
spoke again his voice was softer. “There wasn’t another
colored family for miles around. And now there
ain’t a colored man on this ranch an’ there’s jus’ one
family in Soledad.” He laughed. “If I say something,
why it’s just a nigger sayin’ it.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p670">p670</span>Lennie asked, “How long you think it’ll be before
them pups will be old enough to pet?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p671">p671</span>Crooks laughed again. “A guy can talk to you an’
be sure you won’t go blabbin’. Couple of weeks an’
them pups’ll be all right. George knows what he’s
about. Jus’ talks, an’ you don’t understand nothing.”
He leaned forward excitedly. “This is just a nigger
talkin’, an’ a busted-back nigger. So it don’t mean
nothing, see? You couldn’t remember it anyways. I
seen it over an’ over—a guy talkin’ to another guy and
it don’t make no difference if he don’t hear or understand.
The thing is, they’re talkin’, or they’re settin’
still not talkin’. It don’t make no difference, no difference.”
His excitement had increased until he pounded
his knee with his hand. “George can tell you screwy
things, and it don’t matter. It’s just the talking. It’s just
bein’ with another guy. That’s all.” He paused.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p672">p672</span>His voice grew soft and persuasive. “S’pose George
don’t come back no more. S’pose he took a powder
and just ain’t coming back. What’ll you do then?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p673">p673</span>Lennie’s attention came gradually to what had been
said. “What?” he demanded.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p674">p674</span>“I said s’pose George went into town tonight and
you never heard of him no more.” Crooks pressed
forward some kind of private victory. “Just s’pose
that,” he repeated.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p675">p675</span>“He won’t do it,” Lennie cried. “George wouldn’t
do nothing like that. I been with George a long time.
He’ll come back tonight——” But the doubt was too
much for him. “Don’t you think he will?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p676">p676</span>Crooks’ face lighted with pleasure in his torture.
“Nobody can’t tell what a guy’ll do,” he observed
calmly. “Le’s say he wants to come back and can’t.
S’pose he gets killed or hurt so he can’t come back.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p677">p677</span>Lennie struggled to understand. “George won’t do
nothing like that,” he repeated. “George is careful. He
won’t get hurt. He ain’t never been hurt, ’cause he’s
careful.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p678">p678</span>“Well, s’pose, jus’ s’pose he don’t come back.
What’ll you do then?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p679">p679</span>Lennie’s face wrinkled with apprehension. “I don’
know. Say, what you doin’ anyways?” he cried. “This
ain’t true. George ain’t got hurt.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p680">p680</span>Crooks bored in on him. “Want me ta tell ya what’ll
happen? They’ll take ya to the booby hatch. They’ll
tie ya up with a collar, like a dog.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p681">p681</span>Suddenly Lennie’s eyes centered and grew quiet,
and mad. He stood up and walked dangerously toward
Crooks. “Who hurt George?” he demanded.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p682">p682</span>Crooks saw the danger as it approached him. He
edged back on his bunk to get out of the way. “I was
just supposin’,” he said. “George ain’t hurt. He’s all
right. He’ll be back all right.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p683">p683</span>Lennie stood over him. “What you supposin’ for?
Ain’t nobody goin’ to suppose no hurt to George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p684">p684</span>Crooks removed his glasses and wiped his eyes with
his fingers. “Jus’ set down,” he said. “George ain’t
hurt.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p685">p685</span>Lennie growled back to his seat on the nail keg.
“Ain’t nobody goin’ to talk no hurt to George,” he
grumbled.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p686">p686</span>Crooks said gently, “Maybe you can see now. You
got George. You <span class="it">know</span> he’s goin’ to come back. S’pose
you didn’t have nobody. S’pose you couldn’t go into
the bunk house and play rummy ’cause you was black.
How’d you like that? S’pose you had to sit out here
an’ read books. Sure you could play horseshoes till it
got dark, but then you got to read books. Books ain’t
no good. A guy needs somebody—to be near him.”
He whined, “A guy goes nuts if he ain’t got nobody.
Don’t make no difference who the guy is, long’s he’s
with you. I tell ya,” he cried, “I tell ya a guy gets too
lonely an’ he gets sick.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p687">p687</span>“George gonna come back,” Lennie reassured himself
in a frightened voice. “Maybe George come back
already. Maybe I better go see.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p688">p688</span>Crooks said, “I didn’t mean to scare you. He’ll come
back. I was talkin’ about myself. A guy sets alone out
here at night, maybe readin’ books or thinkin’ or stuff
like that. Sometimes he gets thinkin’, an’ he got
nothing to tell him what’s so an’ what ain’t so. Maybe
if he sees somethin’, he don’t know whether it’s
right or not. He can’t turn to some other guy and
ast him if he sees it too. He can’t tell. He got nothing
to measure by. I seen things out here. I wasn’t drunk.
I don’t know if I was asleep. If some guy was with me,
he could tell me I was asleep, an’ then it would be all
right. But I jus’ don’t know.” Crooks was looking
across the room now, looking toward the window.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p689">p689</span>Lennie said miserably, “George wun’t go away and
leave me. I know George wun’t do that.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p690">p690</span>The stable buck went on dreamily, “I remember
when I was a little kid on my old man’s chicken ranch.
Had two brothers. They was always near me, always
there. Used to sleep right in the same room, right in
the same bed—all three. Had a strawberry patch. Had
an alfalfa patch. Used to turn the chickens out in the
alfalfa on a sunny morning. My brothers’d set on a
fence rail an’ watch ’em—white chickens they was.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p691">p691</span>Gradually Lennie’s interest came around to what
was being said. “George says we’re gonna have alfalfa
for the rabbits.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p692">p692</span>“What rabbits?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p693">p693</span>“We’re gonna have rabbits an’ a berry patch.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p694">p694</span>“You’re nuts.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p695">p695</span>“We are too. You ast George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p696">p696</span>“You’re nuts.” Crooks was scornful. “I seen hunderds
of men come by on the road an’ on the ranches,
with their bindles on their back an’ that same damn
thing in their heads. Hunderds of them. They come,
an’ they quit an’ go on; an’ every damn one of ’em’s
got a little piece of land in his head. An’ never a God
damn one of ’em ever gets it. Just like heaven. Ever’body
wants a little piece of lan’. I read plenty of books
out here. Nobody never gets to heaven, and nobody
gets no land. It’s just in their head. They’re all the time
talkin’ about it, but it’s jus’ in their head.” He paused
and looked toward the open door, for the horses were
moving restlessly and the halter chains clinked. A
horse whinnied. “I guess somebody’s out there,” Crooks
said. “Maybe Slim. Slim comes in sometimes two, three
times a night. Slim’s a real skinner. He looks out for
his team.” He pulled himself painfully upright and
moved toward the door. “That you, Slim?” he called.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p697">p697</span>Candy’s voice answered. “Slim went in town. Say,
you seen Lennie?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p698">p698</span>“Ya mean the big guy?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p699">p699</span>“Yeah. Seen him around any place?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p700">p700</span>“He’s in here,” Crooks said shortly. He went back
to his bunk and lay down.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p701">p701</span>Candy stood in the doorway scratching his bald
wrist and looking blindly into the lighted room. He
made no attempt to enter. “Tell ya what, Lennie. I
been figuring out about them rabbits.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p702">p702</span>Crooks said irritably, “You can come in if you
want.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p703">p703</span>Candy seemed embarrassed. “I do’ know. ’Course,
if ya want me to.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p704">p704</span>“Come on in. If ever’body’s comin’ in, you might
just as well.” It was difficult for Crooks to conceal his
pleasure with anger.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p705">p705</span>Candy came in, but he was still embarrassed. “You
got a nice cozy little place in here,” he said to Crooks.
“Must be nice to have a room all to yourself this way.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p706">p706</span>“Sure,” said Crooks. “And a manure pile under the
window. Sure, it’s swell.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p707">p707</span>Lennie broke in, “You said about them rabbits.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p708">p708</span>Candy leaned against the wall beside the broken
collar while he scratched the wrist stump. “I been here
a long time,” he said. “An’ Crooks been here a long
time. This’s the first time I ever been in his room.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p709">p709</span>Crooks said darkly, “Guys don’t come into a colored
man’s room very much. Nobody been here but
Slim. Slim an’ the boss.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p710">p710</span>Candy quickly changed the subject. “Slim’s as good
a skinner as I ever seen.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p711">p711</span>Lennie leaned toward the old swamper. “About
them rabbits,” he insisted.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p712">p712</span>Candy smiled. “I got it figured out. We can make
some money on them rabbits if we go about it right.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p713">p713</span>“But I get to tend ’em,” Lennie broke in. “George
says I get to tend ’em. He promised.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p714">p714</span>Crooks interrupted brutally. “You guys is just kiddin’
yourself. You’ll talk about it a hell of a lot, but
you won’t get no land. You’ll be a swamper here till
they take you out in a box. Hell, I seen too many guys.
Lennie here’ll quit an’ be on the road in two, three
weeks. Seems like ever’ guy got land in his head.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p715">p715</span>Candy rubbed his cheek angrily. “You God damn
right we’re gonna do it. George says we are. We got
the money right now.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p716">p716</span>“Yeah?” said Crooks. “An’ where’s George now?
In town in a whore house. That’s where your money’s
goin’. Jesus, I seen it happen too many times. I seen
too many guys with land in their head. They never get
none under their hand.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p717">p717</span>Candy cried, “Sure they all want it. Everybody
wants a little bit of land, not much. Jus’ som’thin’ that
was his. Somethin’ he could live on and there couldn’t
nobody throw him off of it. I never had none. I planted
crops for damn near ever’body in this state, but they
wasn’t my crops, and when I harvested ’em, it wasn’t
none of my harvest. But we gonna do it now, and
don’t make no mistake about that. George ain’t got the
money in town. That money’s in the bank. Me an’
Lennie an’ George. We gonna have a room to ourself.
We’re gonna have a dog an’ rabbits an’ chickens.
We’re gonna have green corn an’ maybe a cow or a
goat.” He stopped, overwhelmed with his picture.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p718">p718</span>Crooks asked, “You say you got the money?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p719">p719</span>“Damn right. We got most of it. Just a little bit
more to get. Have it all in one month. George got the
land all picked out, too.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p720">p720</span>Crooks reached around and explored his spine with
his hand. “I never seen a guy really do it,” he said. “I
seen guys nearly crazy with loneliness for land, but
ever’ time a whore house or a blackjack game took
what it takes.” He hesitated. “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. guys
would want a hand to work for nothing—just his
keep, why I’d come an’ lend a hand. I ain’t so crippled
I can’t work like a son-of-a-bitch if I want to.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p721">p721</span>“Any you boys seen Curley?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p722">p722</span>They swung their heads toward the door. Looking
in was Curley’s wife. Her face was heavily made up.
Her lips were slightly parted. She breathed strongly,
as though she had been running.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p723">p723</span>“Curley ain’t been here,” Candy said sourly.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p724">p724</span>She stood still in the doorway, smiling a little at
them, rubbing the nails of one hand with the thumb
and forefinger of the other. And her eyes traveled
from one face to another. “They left all the weak ones
here,” she said finally. “Think I don’t know where
they all went? Even Curley. I know where they all
went.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p725">p725</span>Lennie watched her, fascinated; but Candy and
Crooks were scowling down away from her eyes.
Candy said, “Then if you know, why you want to ast
us where Curley is at?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p726">p726</span>She regarded them amusedly. “Funny thing,” she
said. “If I catch any one man, and he’s alone, I get
along fine with him. But just let two of the guys get
together an’ you won’t talk. Jus’ nothing but mad.”
She dropped her fingers and put her hands on her hips.
“You’re all scared of each other, that’s what. Ever’ one
of you’s scared the rest is goin’ to get something on
you.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p727">p727</span>After a pause Crooks said, “Maybe you better go
along to your own house now. We don’t want no
trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p728">p728</span>“Well, I ain’t giving you no trouble. Think I don’t
like to talk to somebody ever’ once in a while? Think
I like to stick in that house alla time?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p729">p729</span>Candy laid the stump of his wrist on his knee and
rubbed it gently with his hand. He said accusingly,
“You gotta husban’. You got no call foolin’ aroun’
with other guys, causin’ trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p730">p730</span>The girl flared up. “Sure I gotta husban’. You all
seen him. Swell guy, ain’t he? Spends all his time sayin’
what he’s gonna do to guys he don’t like, and he don’t
like nobody. Think I’m gonna stay in that two-by-four
house and listen how Curley’s gonna lead with his
left twict, and then bring in the ol’ right cross? ‘One-two’
he says. ‘Jus the ol’ one-two an’ he’ll go down.’ ”
She paused and her face lost its sullenness and grew
interested. “Say—what happened to Curley’s han’?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p731">p731</span>There was an embarrassed silence. Candy stole a
look at Lennie. Then he coughed. “Why .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Curley
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he got his han’ caught in a machine, ma’am. Bust
his han’.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p732">p732</span>She watched for a moment, and then she laughed.
“Baloney! What you think you’re sellin’ me? Curley
started som’pin’ he didn’ finish. Caught in a machine—baloney!
Why, he ain’t give nobody the good ol’
one-two since he got his han’ bust. Who bust him?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p733">p733</span>Candy repeated sullenly, “Got it caught in a machine.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p734">p734</span>“Awright,” she said contemptuously. “Awright,
cover ’im up if ya wanta. Whatta I care? You bindle
bums think you’re so damn good. Whatta ya think
I am, a kid? I tell ya I could of went with shows. Not
jus’ one, neither. An’ a guy tol’ me he could put me
in pitchers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” She was breathless with indignation.
“—Sat’iday night. Ever’body out doin’ som’pin’. Ever’body!
An’ what am I doin’? Standin’ here talkin’
to a bunch of bindle stiffs—a nigger an’ a dum-dum
and a lousy ol’ sheep—an’ likin’ it because they ain’t
nobody else.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p735">p735</span>Lennie watched her, his mouth half open. Crooks
had retired into the terrible protective dignity of the
negro. But a change came over old Candy. He stood
up suddenly and knocked his nail keg over backward.
“I had enough,” he said angrily. “You ain’t wanted
here. We told you you ain’t. An’ I tell ya, you got
floozy idears about what us guys amounts to. You
ain’t got sense enough in that chicken head to even
see that we ain’t stiffs. S’pose you get us canned.
S’pose you do. You think we’ll hit the highway an’
look for another lousy two-bit job like this. You don’t
know that we got our own ranch to go to, an’ our
own house. We ain’t got to stay here. We gotta
house and chickens an’ fruit trees an’ a place a hunderd
time prettier than this. An’ we got fren’s, that’s
what we got. Maybe there was a time when we was
scared of gettin’ canned, but we ain’t no more. We
got our own lan’, and it’s ours, an’ we c’n go to it.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p736">p736</span>Curley’s wife laughed at him. “Baloney,” she said.
“I seen too many you guys. If you had two bits in
the worl’, why you’d be in gettin’ two shots of corn
with it and suckin’ the bottom of the glass. I know
you guys.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p737">p737</span>Candy’s face had grown redder and redder, but before
she was done speaking, he had control of himself.
He was the master of the situation. “I might of
knew,” he said gently. “Maybe you just better go
along an’ roll your hoop. We ain’t got nothing to say
to you at all. We know what we got, and we don’t care
whether you know it or not. So maybe you better jus’
scatter along now, ’cause Curley maybe ain’t gonna
like his wife out in the barn with us ‘bindle stiffs.’ ”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p738">p738</span>She looked from one face to another, and they were
all closed against her. And she looked longest at Lennie,
until he dropped his eyes in embarrassment. Suddenly
she said, “Where’d you get them bruises on
your face?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p739">p739</span>Lennie looked up guiltily. “Who—me?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p740">p740</span>“Yeah, you.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p741">p741</span>Lennie looked to Candy for help, and then he
looked at his lap again. “He got his han’ caught in a
machine,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p742">p742</span>Curley’s wife laughed. “O.K., Machine. I’ll talk to
you later. I like machines.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p743">p743</span>Candy broke in. “You let this guy alone. Don’t you
do no messing aroun’ with him. I’m gonna tell George
what you says. George won’t have you messin’ with
Lennie.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p744">p744</span>“Who’s George?” she asked. “The little guy you
come with?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p745">p745</span>Lennie smiled happily. “That’s him,” he said.
“That’s the guy, an’ he’s gonna let me tend the rabbits.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p746">p746</span>“Well, if that’s all you want, I might get a couple
rabbits myself.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p747">p747</span>Crooks stood up from his bunk and faced her. “I
had enough,” he said coldly. “You got no rights comin’
in a colored man’s room. You got no rights messing
around in here at all. Now you jus’ get out, an’
get out quick. If you don’t, I’m gonna ast the boss
not to ever let you come in the barn no more.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p748">p748</span>She turned on him in scorn. “Listen, Nigger,” she
said. “You know what I can do to you if you open
your trap?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p749">p749</span>Crooks stared hopelessly at her, and then he sat
down on his bunk and drew into himself.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p750">p750</span>She closed on him. “You know what I could do?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p751">p751</span>Crooks seemed to grow smaller, and he pressed
himself against the wall. “Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p752">p752</span>“Well, you keep your place then, Nigger. I could
get you strung up on a tree so easy it ain’t even funny.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p753">p753</span>Crooks had reduced himself to nothing. There was
no personality, no ego—nothing to arouse either like
or dislike. He said, “Yes, ma’am,” and his voice was
toneless.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p754">p754</span>For a moment she stood over him as though waiting
for him to move so that she could whip at him again;
but Crooks sat perfectly still, his eyes averted, everything
that might be hurt drawn in. She turned at last
to the other two.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p755">p755</span>Old Candy was watching her, fascinated. “If you
was to do that, we’d tell,” he said quietly. “We’d
tell about you framin’ Crooks.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p756">p756</span>“Tell an’ be damned,” she cried. “Nobody’d listen
to you, an’ you know it. Nobody’d listen to you.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p757">p757</span>Candy subsided. “No .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” he agreed. “Nobody’d
listen to us.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p758">p758</span>Lennie whined, “I wisht George was here. I wisht
George was here.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p759">p759</span>Candy stepped over to him. “Don’t you worry
none,” he said. “I jus’ heard the guys comin’ in.
George’ll be in the bunk house right now, I bet.” He
turned to Curley’s wife. “You better go home now,”
he said quietly. “If you go right now, we won’t tell
Curley you was here.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p760">p760</span>She appraised him coolly. “I ain’t sure you heard
nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p761">p761</span>“Better not take no chances,” he said. “If you ain’t
sure, you better take the safe way.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p762">p762</span>She turned to Lennie. “I’m glad you bust up Curley
a little bit. He got it comin’ to him. Sometimes I’d
like to bust him myself.” She slipped out the door and
disappeared into the dark barn. And while she went
through the barn, the halter chains rattled, and some
horses snorted and some stamped their feet.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p763">p763</span>Crooks seemed to come slowly out of the layers of
protection he had put on. “Was that the truth what
you said about the guys come back?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p764">p764</span>“Sure. I heard ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p765">p765</span>“Well, I didn’t hear nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p766">p766</span>“The gate banged,” Candy said, and he went on,
“Jesus Christ, Curley’s wife can move quiet. I guess
she had a lot of practice, though.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p767">p767</span>Crooks avoided the whole subject now. “Maybe
you guys better go,” he said. “I ain’t sure I want you
in here no more. A colored man got to have some
rights even if he don’t like ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p768">p768</span>Candy said, “That bitch didn’t ought to of said
that to you.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p769">p769</span>“It wasn’t nothing,” Crooks said dully. “You guys
comin’ in an’ settin’ made me forget. What she says
is true.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p770">p770</span>The horses snorted out in the barn and the chains
rang and a voice called, “Lennie. Oh, Lennie. You
in the barn?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p771">p771</span>“It’s George,” Lennie cried. And he answered,
“Here, George. I’m right in here.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p772">p772</span>In a second George stood framed in the door, and
he looked disapprovingly about. “What you doin’ in
Crooks’ room. You hadn’t ought to be in here.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p773">p773</span>Crooks nodded. “I tol’ ’em, but they come in anyways.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p774">p774</span>“Well, why’n’t you kick ’em out?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p775">p775</span>“I di’n’t care much,” said Crooks. “Lennie’s a nice
fella.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p776">p776</span>Now Candy aroused himself. “Oh, George! I been
figurin’ and figurin’. I got it doped out how we can
even make some money on them rabbits.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p777">p777</span>George scowled. “I thought I tol’ you not to tell
nobody about that.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p778">p778</span>Candy was crestfallen. “Didn’t tell nobody but
Crooks.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p779">p779</span>George said, “Well you guys get outta here. Jesus,
seems like I can’t go away for a minute.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p780">p780</span>Candy and Lennie stood up and went toward the
door. Crooks called, “Candy!”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p781">p781</span>“Huh?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p782">p782</span>“ ’Member what I said about hoein’ and doin’ odd
jobs?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p783">p783</span>“Yeah,” said Candy. “I remember.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p784">p784</span>“Well, jus’ forget it,” said Crooks. “I didn’ mean
it. Jus’ foolin’. I wouldn’ want to go no place like
that.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p785">p785</span>“Well, O.K., if you feel like that. Goodnight.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p786">p786</span>The three men went out of the door. As they went
through the barn the horses snorted and the halter
chains rattled.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p787">p787</span>Crooks sat on his bunk and looked at the door for
a moment, and then he reached for the liniment bottle.
He pulled out his shirt in back, poured a little
liniment in his pink palm and, reaching around, he
fell slowly to rubbing his back.</p>

<div><h1 id="5">5</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="counter" id="p788">p788</span><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">O</span>ne</span> end of the great barn was piled high with
new hay and over the pile hung the four-taloned
Jackson fork suspended from its pulley. The hay came
down like a mountain slope to the other end of the
barn, and there was a level place as yet unfilled with
the new crop. At the sides the feeding racks were
visible, and between the slats the heads of horses
could be seen.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p789">p789</span>It was Sunday afternoon. The resting horses nibbled
the remaining wisps of hay, and they stamped
their feet and they bit the wood of the mangers and
rattled the halter chains. The afternoon sun sliced in
through the cracks of the barn walls and lay in bright
lines on the hay. There was the buzz of flies in the
air, the lazy afternoon humming.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p790">p790</span>From outside came the clang of horseshoes on the
playing peg and the shouts of men, playing, encouraging,
jeering. But in the barn it was quiet and humming
and lazy and warm.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p791">p791</span>Only Lennie was in the barn, and Lennie sat in the
hay beside a packing case under a manger in the end
of the barn that had not been filled with hay. Lennie
sat in the hay and looked at a little dead puppy that
lay in front of him. Lennie looked at it for a long
time, and then he put out his huge hand and stroked
it, stroked it clear from one end to the other.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p792">p792</span>And Lennie said softly to the puppy, “Why do you
got to get killed? You ain’t so little as mice. I didn’t
bounce you hard.” He bent the pup’s head up and
looked in its face, and he said to it, “Now maybe
George ain’t gonna let me tend no rabbits, if he fin’s
out you got killed.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p793">p793</span>He scooped a little hollow and laid the puppy in it
and covered it over with hay, out of sight; but he
continued to stare at the mound he had made. He
said, “This ain’t no bad thing like I got to go hide in
the brush. Oh! no. This ain’t. I’ll tell George I foun’
it dead.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p794">p794</span>He unburied the puppy and inspected it, and he
stroked it from ears to tail. He went on sorrowfully,
“But he’ll know. George always knows. He’ll say,
‘You done it. Don’t try to put nothing over on me.’
An’ he’ll say, ‘Now jus’ for that you don’t get to tend
no rabbits!’ ”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p795">p795</span>Suddenly his anger arose. “God damn you,” he
cried. “Why do you got to get killed? You ain’t so
little as mice.” He picked up the pup and hurled it
from him. He turned his back on it. He sat bent over
his knees and he whispered, “Now I won’t get to tend
the rabbits. Now he won’t let me.” He rocked himself
back and forth in his sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p796">p796</span>From outside came the clang of horseshoes on the
iron stake, and then a little chorus of cries. Lennie
got up and brought the puppy back and laid it on
the hay and sat down. He stroked the pup again.
“You wasn’t big enough,” he said. “They tol’ me and
tol’ me you wasn’t. I di’n’t know you’d get killed so
easy.” He worked his fingers on the pup’s limp ear.
“Maybe George won’t care,” he said. “This here
God damn little son-of-a-bitch wasn’t nothing to
George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p797">p797</span>Curley’s wife came around the end of the last stall.
She came very quietly, so that Lennie didn’t see her.
She wore her bright cotton dress and the mules with
the red ostrich feathers. Her face was made up and
the little sausage curls were all in place. She was quite
near to him before Lennie looked up and saw her.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p798">p798</span>In a panic he shoveled hay over the puppy with his
fingers. He looked sullenly up at her.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p799">p799</span>She said, “What you got there, sonny boy?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p800">p800</span>Lennie glared at her. “George says I ain’t to have
nothing to do with you—talk to you or nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p801">p801</span>She laughed. “George giving you orders about everything?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p802">p802</span>Lennie looked down at the hay. “Says I can’t tend
no rabbits if I talk to you or anything.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p803">p803</span>She said quietly, “He’s scared Curley’ll get mad.
Well, Curley got his arm in a sling—an’ if Curley
gets tough, you can break his other han’. You didn’t
put nothing over on me about gettin’ it caught in no
machine.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p804">p804</span>But Lennie was not to be drawn. “No, sir. I ain’t
gonna talk to you or nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p805">p805</span>She knelt in the hay beside him. “Listen,” she said.
“All the guys got a horseshoe tenement goin’ on. It’s
on’y about four o’clock. None of them guys is goin’
to leave that tenement. Why can’t I talk to you? I
never get to talk to nobody. I get awful lonely.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p806">p806</span>Lennie said, “Well, I ain’t supposed to talk to you
or nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p807">p807</span>“I get lonely,” she said. “You can talk to people,
but I can’t talk to nobody but Curley. Else he gets
mad. How’d you like not to talk to anybody?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p808">p808</span>Lennie said, “Well, I ain’t supposed to. George’s
scared I’ll get in trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p809">p809</span>She changed the subject. “What you got covered
up there?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p810">p810</span>Then all of Lennie’s woe came back on him. “Jus’
my pup,” he said sadly. “Jus’ my little pup.” And
he swept the hay from on top of it.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p811">p811</span>“Why, he’s dead,” she cried.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p812">p812</span>“He was so little,” said Lennie. “I was jus’ playin’
with him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an’ he made like he’s gonna bite me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
an’ I made like I was gonna smack him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an’
I done it. An’ then he was dead.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p813">p813</span>She consoled him. “Don’t you worry none. He was
jus’ a mutt. You can get another one easy. The whole
country is fulla mutts.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p814">p814</span>“It ain’t that so much,” Lennie explained miserably.
“George ain’t gonna let me tend no rabbits now.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p815">p815</span>“Why don’t he?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p816">p816</span>“Well, he said if I done any more bad things he
ain’t gonna let me tend the rabbits.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p817">p817</span>She moved closer to him and she spoke soothingly.
“Don’t you worry about talkin’ to me. Listen to the
guys yell out there. They got four dollars bet in that
tenement. None of them ain’t gonna leave till it’s
over.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p818">p818</span>“If George sees me talkin’ to you he’ll give me hell,”
Lennie said cautiously. “He tol’ me so.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p819">p819</span>Her face grew angry. “Wha’s the matter with me?”
she cried. “Ain’t I got a right to talk to nobody?
Whatta they think I am, anyways? You’re a nice guy.
I don’t know why I can’t talk to you. I ain’t doin’ no
harm to you.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p820">p820</span>“Well, George says you’ll get us in a mess.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p821">p821</span>“Aw, nuts!” she said. “What kinda harm am I doin’
to you? Seems like they ain’t none of them cares how
I gotta live. I tell you I ain’t used to livin’ like this. I
coulda made somethin’ of myself.” She said darkly,
“Maybe I will yet.” And then her words tumbled out
in a passion of communication, as though she hurried
before her listener could be taken away. “I lived right
in Salinas,” she said. “Come there when I was a kid.
Well, a show come through, an’ I met one of the actors.
He says I could go with that show. But my ol’
lady wouldn’ let me. She says because I was on’y fifteen.
But the guy says I coulda. If I’d went, I wouldn’t
be livin’ like this, you bet.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p822">p822</span>Lennie stroked the pup back and forth. “We gonna
have a little place—an’ rabbits,” he explained.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p823">p823</span>She went on with her story quickly, before she
should be interrupted. “ ’Nother time I met a guy, an’
he was in pitchers. Went out to the Riverside Dance
Palace with him. He says he was gonna put me in the
movies. Says I was a natural. Soon’s he got back to
Hollywood he was gonna write to me about it.” She
looked closely at Lennie to see whether she was impressing
him. “I never got that letter,” she said. “I
always thought my ol’ lady stole it. Well, I wasn’t
gonna stay no place where I couldn’t get nowhere or
make something of myself, an’ where they stole your
letters. I ast her if she stole it, too, an’ she says no. So
I married Curley. Met him out to the Riverside Dance
Palace that same night.” She demanded, “You listenin’?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p824">p824</span>“Me? Sure.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p825">p825</span>“Well, I ain’t told this to nobody before. Maybe I
ought’n to. I don’ <span class="it">like</span> Curley. He ain’t a nice fella.”
And because she had confided in him, she moved
closer to Lennie and sat beside him. “Coulda been in
the movies, an’ had nice clothes—all them nice clothes
like they wear. An’ I coulda sat in them big hotels, an’
had pitchers took of me. When they had them previews
I coulda went to them, an’ spoke in the radio,
an’ it wouldn’ta cost me a cent because I was in the
pitcher. An’ all them nice clothes like they wear. Because
this guy says I was a natural.” She looked up
at Lennie, and she made a small grand gesture with
her arm and hand to show that she could act. The
fingers trailed after her leading wrist, and her little
finger stuck out grandly from the rest.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p826">p826</span>Lennie sighed deeply. From outside came the clang
of a horseshoe on metal, and then a chorus of cheers.
“Somebody made a ringer,” said Curley’s wife.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p827">p827</span>Now the light was lifting as the sun went down,
and the sun streaks climbed up the wall and fell over
the feeding racks and over the heads of the horses.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p828">p828</span>Lennie said, “Maybe if I took this pup out and
throwed him away George wouldn’t never know. An’
then I could tend the rabbits without no trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p829">p829</span>Curley’s wife said angrily, “Don’t you think of
nothing but rabbits?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p830">p830</span>“We gonna have a little place,” Lennie explained
patiently. “We gonna have a house an’ a garden and
a place for alfalfa, an’ that alfalfa is for the rabbits,
an’ I take a sack and get it all fulla alfalfa and then I
take it to the rabbits.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p831">p831</span>She asked, “What makes you so nuts about rabbits?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p832">p832</span>Lennie had to think carefully before he could come
to a conclusion. He moved cautiously close to her,
until he was right against her. “I like to pet nice
things. Once at a fair I seen some of them long-hair
rabbits. An’ they was nice, you bet. Sometimes I’ve
even pet mice, but not when I could get nothing better.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p833">p833</span>Curley’s wife moved away from him a little. “I
think you’re nuts,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p834">p834</span>“No I ain’t,” Lennie explained earnestly. “George
says I ain’t. I like to pet nice things with my fingers,
sof’ things.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p835">p835</span>She was a little bit reassured. “Well, who don’t?”
she said. “Ever’body likes that. I like to feel silk an’
velvet. Do you like to feel velvet?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p836">p836</span>Lennie chuckled with pleasure. “You bet, by God,”
he cried happily. “An’ I had some, too. A lady give
me some, an’ that lady was—my own Aunt Clara.
She give it right to me—’bout this big a piece. I wisht
I had that velvet right now.” A frown came over his
face. “I lost it,” he said. “I ain’t seen it for a long
time.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p837">p837</span>Curley’s wife laughed at him. “You’re nuts,” she
said. “But you’re a kinda nice fella. Jus’ like a big
baby. But a person can see kinda what you mean.
When I’m doin’ my hair sometimes I jus’ set an’
stroke it ’cause it’s so soft.” To show how she did it,
she ran her fingers over the top of her head. “Some
people got kinda coarse hair,” she said complacently.
“Take Curley. His hair is jus’ like wire. But mine is
soft and fine. ’Course I brush it a lot. That makes it
fine. Here—feel right here.” She took Lennie’s hand
and put it on her head. “Feel right aroun’ there an’
see how soft it is.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p838">p838</span>Lennie’s big fingers fell to stroking her hair.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p839">p839</span>“Don’t you muss it up,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p840">p840</span>Lennie said, “Oh! That’s nice,” and he stroked
harder. “Oh, that’s nice.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p841">p841</span>“Look out, now, you’ll muss it.” And then she
cried angrily, “You stop it now, you’ll mess it all up.”
She jerked her head sideways, and Lennie’s fingers
closed on her hair and hung on. “Let go,” she cried.
“You let go!”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p842">p842</span>Lennie was in a panic. His face was contorted. She
screamed then, and Lennie’s other hand closed over
her mouth and nose. “Please don’t,” he begged. “Oh!
Please don’t do that. George’ll be mad.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p843">p843</span>She struggled violently under his hands. Her feet
battered on the hay and she writhed to be free; and
from under Lennie’s hand came a muffled screaming.
Lennie began to cry with fright. “Oh! Please don’t
do none of that,” he begged. “George gonna say I
done a bad thing. He ain’t gonna let me tend no rabbits.”
He moved his hand a little and her hoarse cry
came out. Then Lennie grew angry. “Now don’t,”
he said. “I don’t want you to yell. You gonna get me
in trouble jus’ like George says you will. Now don’t
you do that.” And she continued to struggle, and
her eyes were wild with terror. He shook her then,
and he was angry with her. “Don’t you go yellin’,”
he said, and he shook her; and her body flopped like
a fish. And then she was still, for Lennie had broken
her neck.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p844">p844</span>He looked down at her, and carefully he removed
his hand from over her mouth, and she lay still. “I
don’t want ta hurt you,” he said, “but George’ll be
mad if you yell.” When she didn’t answer nor move
he bent closely over her. He lifted her arm and let it
drop. For a moment he seemed bewildered. And then
he whispered in fright, “I done a bad thing. I done
another bad thing.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p845">p845</span>He pawed up the hay until it partly covered her.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p846">p846</span>From outside the barn came a cry of men and the
double clang of shoes on metal. For the first time Lennie
became conscious of the outside. He crouched
down in the hay and listened. “I done a real bad
thing,” he said. “I shouldn’t of did that. George’ll be
mad. An’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he said .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an’ hide in the brush till he
come. He’s gonna be mad. In the brush till he come.
Tha’s what he said.” Lennie went back and looked at the
dead girl. The puppy lay close to her. Lennie picked
it up. “I’ll throw him away,” he said. “It’s bad enough
like it is.” He put the pup under his coat, and he
crept to the barn wall and peered out between the
cracks, toward the horseshoe game. And then he crept
around the end of the last manger and disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p847">p847</span>The sun streaks were high on the wall by now, and
the light was growing soft in the barn. Curley’s wife
lay on her back, and she was half covered with hay.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p848">p848</span>It was very quiet in the barn, and the quiet of the
afternoon was on the ranch. Even the clang of the
pitched shoes, even the voices of the men in the game
seemed to grow more quiet. The air in the barn was
dusky in advance of the outside day. A pigeon flew
in through the open hay door and circled and flew out
again. Around the last stall came a shepherd bitch,
lean and long, with heavy, hanging dugs. Halfway to
the packing box where the puppies were she caught
the dead scent of Curley’s wife, and the hair rose
along her spine. She whimpered and cringed to the
packing box, and jumped in among the puppies.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p849">p849</span>Curley’s wife lay with a half-covering of yellow
hay. And the meanness and the plannings and the discontent
and the ache for attention were all gone from
her face. She was very pretty and simple, and her face
was sweet and young. Now her rouged cheeks and
her reddened lips made her seem alive and sleeping very
lightly. The curls, tiny little sausages, were spread on
the hay behind her head, and her lips were parted.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p850">p850</span>As happens sometimes, a moment settled and hovered
and remained for much more than a moment.
And sound stopped and movement stopped for much,
much more than a moment.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p851">p851</span>Then gradually time awakened again and moved
sluggishly on. The horses stamped on the other side
of the feeding racks and the halter chains clinked.
Outside, the men’s voices became louder and clearer.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p852">p852</span>From around the end of the last stall old Candy’s
voice came. “Lennie,” he called. “Oh, Lennie! You
in here? I been figuring some more. Tell you what we
can do, Lennie.” Old Candy appeared around the end
of the last stall. “Oh, Lennie!” he called again; and
then he stopped, and his body stiffened. He rubbed
his smooth wrist on his white stubble whiskers. “I
di’n’t know you was here,” he said to Curley’s wife.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p853">p853</span>When she didn’t answer, he stepped nearer. “You
oughten to sleep out here,” he said disapprovingly;
and then he was beside her and—“Oh, Jesus Christ!”
He looked about helplessly, and he rubbed his beard.
And then he jumped up and went quickly out of the
barn.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p854">p854</span>But the barn was alive now. The horses stamped
and snorted, and they chewed the straw of their bedding
and they clashed the chains of their halters. In
a moment Candy came back, and George was with
him.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p855">p855</span>George said, “What was it you wanted to see me
about?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p856">p856</span>Candy pointed at Curley’s wife. George stared.
“What’s the matter with her?” he asked. He stepped
closer, and then he echoed Candy’s words. “Oh, Jesus
Christ!” He was down on his knees beside her. He
put his hand over her heart. And finally, when he
stood up, slowly and stiffly, his face was as hard and
tight as wood, and his eyes were hard.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p857">p857</span>Candy said, “What done it?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p858">p858</span>George looked coldly at him. “Ain’t you got any
idear?” he asked. And Candy was silent. “I should of
knew,” George said hopelessly. “I guess maybe way
back in my head I did.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p859">p859</span>Candy asked, “What we gonna do now, George?
What we gonna do now?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p860">p860</span>George was a long time in answering. “Guess .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
we gotta tell the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. guys. I guess we gotta get ’im an’
lock ’im up. We can’t let ’im get away. Why, the
poor bastard’d starve.” And he tried to reassure himself.
“Maybe they’ll lock ’im up an’ be nice to ’im.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p861">p861</span>But Candy said excitedly, “We oughtta let ’im get
away. You don’t know that Curley. Curley gon’ta
wanta get ’im lynched. Curley’ll get ’im killed.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p862">p862</span>George watched Candy’s lips. “Yeah,” he said at
last, “that’s right, Curley will. An’ the other guys
will.” And he looked back at Curley’s wife.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p863">p863</span>Now Candy spoke his greatest fear. “You an’ me
can get that little place, can’t we, George? You an’
me can go there an’ live nice, can’t we, George? Can’t
we?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p864">p864</span>Before George answered, Candy dropped his head
and looked down at the hay. He knew.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p865">p865</span>George said softly, “—I think I knowed from the
very first. I think I knowed we’d never do her. He
usta like to hear about it so much I got to thinking
maybe we would.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p866">p866</span>“Then—it’s all off?” Candy asked sulkily.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p867">p867</span>George didn’t answer his question. George said, “I’ll
work my month an’ I’ll take my fifty bucks an’ I’ll
stay all night in some lousy cat house. Or I’ll set in
some poolroom till ever’body goes home. An’ then I’ll
come back an’ work another month an’ I’ll have fifty
bucks more.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p868">p868</span>Candy said, “He’s such a nice fella. I didn’ think
he’d do nothing like this.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p869">p869</span>George still stared at Curley’s wife. “Lennie never
done it in meanness,” he said. “All the time he done
bad things, but he never done one of ’em mean.” He
straightened up and looked back at Candy. “Now
listen. We gotta tell the guys. They got to bring him
in, I guess. They ain’t no way out. Maybe they won’t
hurt ’im.” He said sharply, “I ain’t gonna let ’em hurt
Lennie. Now you listen. The guys might think I was
in on it. I’m gonna go in the bunk house. Then in a
minute you come out and tell the guys about her, and
I’ll come along and make like I never seen her. Will
you do that? So the guys won’t think I was in on it?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p870">p870</span>Candy said, “Sure, George. Sure I’ll do that.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p871">p871</span>“O.K. Give me a couple minutes then, and you
come runnin’ out an’ tell like you jus’ found her. I’m
going now.” George turned and went quickly out of
the barn.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p872">p872</span>Old Candy watched him go. He looked helplessly
back at Curley’s wife, and gradually his sorrow and
his anger grew into words. “You God damn tramp,”
he said viciously. “You done it, di’n’t you? I s’pose
you’re glad. Ever’body knowed you’d mess things up.
You wasn’t no good. You ain’t no good now, you
lousy tart.” He sniveled, and his voice shook. “I could
of hoed in the garden and washed dishes for them
guys.” He paused, and then went on in a singsong.
And he repeated the old words: “If they was a circus
or a baseball game .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we would of went to her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
jus’ said ‘ta hell with work,’ an’ went to her. Never
ast nobody’s say so. An’ they’d of been a pig and
chickens .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an’ in the winter .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the little fat stove
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an’ the rain comin’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an’ us jus’ settin’ there.”
His eyes blinded with tears and he turned and went
weakly out of the barn, and he rubbed his bristly
whiskers with his wrist stump.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p873">p873</span>Outside the noise of the game stopped. There was a
rise of voices in question, a drum of running feet and
the men burst into the barn. Slim and Carlson and
young Whit and Curley, and Crooks keeping back out
of attention range. Candy came after them, and last of
all came George. George had put on his blue denim
coat and buttoned it, and his black hat was pulled
down low over his eyes. The men raced around the
last stall. Their eyes found Curley’s wife in the gloom,
they stopped and stood still and looked.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p874">p874</span>Then Slim went quietly over to her, and he felt her
wrist. One lean finger touched her cheek, and then his
hand went under her slightly twisted neck and his
fingers explored her neck. When he stood up the men
crowded near and the spell was broken.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p875">p875</span>Curley came suddenly to life. “I know who done
it,” he cried. “That big son-of-a-bitch done it. I know
he done it. Why—ever’body else was out there playin’
horseshoes.” He worked himself into a fury. “I’m
gonna get him. I’m going for my shotgun. I’ll kill the
big son-of-a-bitch myself. I’ll shoot ’im in the guts.
Come on, you guys.” He ran furiously out of the barn.
Carlson said, “I’ll get my Luger,” and he ran out too.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p876">p876</span>Slim turned quietly to George. “I guess Lennie done
it, all right,” he said. “Her neck’s bust. Lennie coulda
did that.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p877">p877</span>George didn’t answer, but he nodded slowly. His
hat was so far down on his forehead that his eyes were
covered.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p878">p878</span>Slim went on, “Maybe like that time in Weed you
was tellin’ about.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p879">p879</span>Again George nodded.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p880">p880</span>Slim sighed. “Well, I guess we got to get him.
Where you think he might of went?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p881">p881</span>It seemed to take George some time to free his
words. “He—would of went south,” he said. “We
come from north so he would of went south.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p882">p882</span>“I guess we gotta get ’im,” Slim repeated.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p883">p883</span>George stepped close. “Couldn’ we maybe bring
him in an’ they’ll lock him up? He’s nuts, Slim. He
never done this to be mean.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p884">p884</span>Slim nodded. “We might,” he said. “If we could
keep Curley in, we might. But Curley’s gonna want to
shoot ’im. Curley’s still mad about his hand. An’ s’pose
they lock him up an’ strap him down and put him in
a cage. That ain’t no good, George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p885">p885</span>“I know,” said George. “I know.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p886">p886</span>Carlson came running in. “The bastard’s stole my
Luger,” he shouted. “It ain’t in my bag.” Curley followed
him, and Curley carried a shotgun in his good
hand. Curley was cold now.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p887">p887</span>“All right, you guys,” he said. “The nigger’s got a
shotgun. You take it, Carlson. When you see ’um,
don’t give ’im no chance. Shoot for his guts. That’ll
double ’im over.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p888">p888</span>Whit said excitedly, “I ain’t got a gun.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p889">p889</span>Curley said, “You go in Soledad an’ get a cop. Get
Al Wilts, he’s deputy sheriff. Le’s go now.” He turned
suspiciously on George. “You’re comin’ with us, fella.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p890">p890</span>“Yeah,” said George. “I’ll come. But listen, Curley.
The poor bastard’s nuts. Don’t shoot ’im. He di’n’t
know what he was doin’.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p891">p891</span>“Don’t shoot ’im?” Curley cried. “He got Carlson’s
Luger. ’Course we’ll shoot ’im.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p892">p892</span>George said weakly, “Maybe Carlson lost his gun.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p893">p893</span>“I seen it this morning,” said Carlson. “No, it’s been
took.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p894">p894</span>Slim stood looking down at Curley’s wife. He said,
“Curley—maybe you better stay here with your
wife.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p895">p895</span>Curley’s face reddened. “I’m goin’,” he said. “I’m
gonna shoot the guts outa that big bastard myself, even
if I only got one hand. I’m gonna get ’im.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p896">p896</span>Slim turned to Candy. “You stay here with her
then, Candy. The rest of us better get goin’.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p897">p897</span>They moved away. George stopped a moment beside
Candy and they both looked down at the dead
girl until Curley called, “You George! You stick with
us so we don’t think you had nothin’ to do with this.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p898">p898</span>George moved slowly after them, and his feet
dragged heavily.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p899">p899</span>And when they were gone, Candy squatted down
in the hay and watched the face of Curley’s wife.
“Poor bastard,” he said softly.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p900">p900</span>The sound of the men grew fainter. The barn was
darkening gradually and, in their stalls, the horses
shifted their feet and rattled the halter chains. Old
Candy lay down in the hay and covered his eyes with
his arm.</p>

<div><h1 id="6">6</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="counter" id="p901">p901</span><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> deep green pool of the Salinas River was still
in the late afternoon. Already the sun had left the
valley to go climbing up the slopes of the Gabilan
mountains, and the hilltops were rosy in the sun. But
by the pool among the mottled sycamores, a pleasant
shade had fallen.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p902">p902</span>A water snake glided smoothly up the pool, twisting
its periscope head from side to side; and it swam the
length of the pool and came to the legs of a motionless
heron that stood in the shallows. A silent head and beak
lanced down and plucked it out by the head, and the
beak swallowed the little snake while its tail waved
frantically.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p903">p903</span>A far rush of wind sounded and a gust drove through
the tops of the trees like a wave. The sycamore leaves
turned up their silver sides, the brown, dry leaves on
the ground scudded a few feet. And row on row of
tiny wind waves flowed up the pool’s green surface.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p904">p904</span>As quickly as it had come, the wind died, and the
clearing was quiet again. The heron stood in the shallows,
motionless and waiting. Another little water
snake swam up the pool, turning its periscope head
from side to side.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p905">p905</span>Suddenly Lennie appeared out of the brush, and he
came as silently as a creeping bear moves. The heron
pounded the air with its wings, jacked itself clear of
the water and flew off down river. The little snake
slid in among the reeds at the pool’s side.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p906">p906</span>Lennie came quietly to the pool’s edge. He knelt
down and drank, barely touching his lips to the water.
When a little bird skittered over the dry leaves behind
him, his head jerked up and he strained toward the
sound with eyes and ears until he saw the bird, and
then he dropped his head and drank again.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p907">p907</span>When he was finished, he sat down on the bank,
with his side to the pool, so that he could watch the
trail’s entrance. He embraced his knees and laid his
chin down on his knees.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p908">p908</span>The light climbed on out of the valley, and as it
went, the tops of the mountains seemed to blaze with
increasing brightness.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p909">p909</span>Lennie said softly, “I di’n’t forget, you bet, God
damn. Hide in the brush an’ wait for George.” He
pulled his hat down low over his eyes. “George gonna
give me hell,” he said. “George gonna wish he was
alone an’ not have me botherin’ him.” He turned his
head and looked at the bright mountain tops. “I can go
right off there an’ find a cave,” he said. And he continued
sadly, “—an’ never have no ketchup—but I
won’t care. If George don’t want me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ll go away.
I’ll go away.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p910">p910</span>And then from out of Lennie’s head there came a
little fat old woman. She wore thick bull’s-eye glasses
and she wore a huge gingham apron with pockets, and
she was starched and clean. She stood in front of Lennie
and put her hands on her hips, and she frowned
disapprovingly at him.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p911">p911</span>And when she spoke, it was in Lennie’s voice. “I tol’
you an’ tol’ you,” she said. “I tol’ you, ‘Min’ George
because he’s such a nice fella an’ good to you.’ But you
don’t never take no care. You do bad things.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p912">p912</span>And Lennie answered her, “I tried, Aunt Clara,
ma’am. I tried and tried. I couldn’ help it.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p913">p913</span>“You never give a thought to George,” she went on
in Lennie’s voice. “He been doin’ nice things for you
alla time. When he got a piece a pie you always got
half or more’n half. An’ if they was any ketchup, why
he’d give it all to you.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p914">p914</span>“I know,” said Lennie miserably. “I tried, Aunt
Clara, ma’am. I tried and tried.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p915">p915</span>She interrupted him. “All the time he coulda had
such a good time if it wasn’t for you. He woulda took
his pay an’ raised hell in a whore house, and he coulda
set in a pool room an’ played snooker. But he got to
take care of you.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p916">p916</span>Lennie moaned with grief. “I know, Aunt Clara,
ma’am. I’ll go right off in the hills an’ I’ll fin’ a cave
an’ I’ll live there so I won’t be no more trouble to
George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p917">p917</span>“You jus’ say that,” she said sharply. “You’re always
sayin’ that, an’ you know sonofabitching well you
ain’t never gonna do it. You’ll jus’ stick around an’
stew the b’Jesus outa George all the time.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p918">p918</span>Lennie said, “I might jus’ as well go away. George
ain’t gonna let me tend no rabbits now.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p919">p919</span>Aunt Clara was gone, and from out of Lennie’s head
there came a gigantic rabbit. It sat on its haunches in
front of him, and it waggled its ears and crinkled its
nose at him. And it spoke in Lennie’s voice too.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p920">p920</span>“Tend rabbits,” it said scornfully. “You crazy bastard.
You ain’t fit to lick the boots of no rabbit. You’d
forget ’em and let ’em go hungry. That’s what you’d
do. An’ then what would George think?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p921">p921</span>“I would <span class="it">not</span> forget,” Lennie said loudly.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p922">p922</span>“The hell you wouldn’,” said the rabbit. “You ain’t
worth a greased jack-pin to ram you into hell. Christ
knows George done ever’thing he could to jack you
outa the sewer, but it don’t do no good. If you think
George gonna let you tend rabbits, you’re even
crazier’n usual. He ain’t. He’s gonna beat hell outa you
with a stick, that’s what he’s gonna do.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p923">p923</span>Now Lennie retorted belligerently, “He ain’t neither.
George won’t do nothing like that. I’ve knew George
since—I forget when—and he ain’t never raised his
han’ to me with a stick. He’s nice to me. He ain’t gonna
be mean.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p924">p924</span>“Well he’s sick of you,” said the rabbit. “He’s gonna
beat hell outa you an’ then go away an’ leave you.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p925">p925</span>“He won’t,” Lennie cried frantically. “He won’t do
nothing like that. I know George. Me an’ him travels
together.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p926">p926</span>But the rabbit repeated softly over and over, “He
gonna leave you, ya crazy bastard. He gonna leave ya
all alone. He gonna leave ya, crazy bastard.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p927">p927</span>Lennie put his hands over his ears. “He ain’t, I tell
ya he ain’t.” And he cried, “Oh! George—George—George!”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p928">p928</span>George came quietly out of the brush and the rabbit
scuttled back into Lennie’s brain.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p929">p929</span>George said quietly, “What the hell you yellin’
about?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p930">p930</span>Lennie got up on his knees. “You ain’t gonna leave
me, are ya, George? I know you ain’t.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p931">p931</span>George came stiffly near and sat down beside him.
“No.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p932">p932</span>“I knowed it,” Lennie cried. “You ain’t that kind.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p933">p933</span>George was silent.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p934">p934</span>Lennie said, “George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p935">p935</span>“Yeah?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p936">p936</span>“I done another bad thing.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p937">p937</span>“It don’t make no difference,” George said, and he
fell silent again.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p938">p938</span>Only the topmost ridges were in the sun now. The
shadow in the valley was blue and soft. From the distance
came the sound of men shouting to one another.
George turned his head and listened to the shouts.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p939">p939</span>Lennie said, “George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p940">p940</span>“Yeah?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p941">p941</span>“Ain’t you gonna give me hell?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p942">p942</span>“Give ya hell?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p943">p943</span>“Sure, like you always done before. Like, ‘If I di’n’t
have you I’d take my fifty bucks—’ ”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p944">p944</span>“Jesus Christ, Lennie! You can’t remember nothing
that happens, but you remember ever’ word I say.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p945">p945</span>“Well, ain’t you gonna say it?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p946">p946</span>George shook himself. He said woodenly, “If I was
alone I could live so easy.” His voice was monotonous,
had no emphasis. “I could get a job an’ not have no
mess.” He stopped.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p947">p947</span>“Go on,” said Lennie. “An’ when the enda the
month come—”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p948">p948</span>“An’ when the end of the month come I could take
my fifty bucks an’ go to a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. cat house .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He
stopped again.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p949">p949</span>Lennie looked eagerly at him. “Go on, George.
Ain’t you gonna give me no more hell?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p950">p950</span>“No,” said George.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p951">p951</span>“Well, I can go away,” said Lennie. “I’ll go right off
in the hills an’ find a cave if you don’ want me.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p952">p952</span>George shook himself again. “No,” he said. “I want
you to stay with me here.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p953">p953</span>Lennie said craftily—“Tell me like you done before.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p954">p954</span>“Tell you what?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p955">p955</span>“ ’Bout the other guys an’ about us.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p956">p956</span>George said, “Guys like us got no fambly. They
make a little stake an’ then they blow it in. They ain’t
got nobody in the worl’ that gives a hoot in hell about
’em—”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p957">p957</span>“<span class="it">But not us</span>,” Lennie cried happily. “Tell about us
now.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p958">p958</span>George was quiet for a moment. “But not us,” he
said.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p959">p959</span>“Because—”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p960">p960</span>“Because I got you an’—”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p961">p961</span>“An’ I got you. We got each other, that’s what,
that gives a hoot in hell about us,” Lennie cried in
triumph.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p962">p962</span>The little evening breeze blew over the clearing and
the leaves rustled and the wind waves flowed up the
green pool. And the shouts of men sounded again, this
time much closer than before.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p963">p963</span>George took off his hat. He said shakily, “Take off
your hat, Lennie. The air feels fine.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p964">p964</span>Lennie removed his hat dutifully and laid it on the
ground in front of him. The shadow in the valley was
bluer, and the evening came fast. On the wind the
sound of crashing in the brush came to them.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p965">p965</span>Lennie said, “Tell how it’s gonna be.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p966">p966</span>George had been listening to the distant sounds. For
a moment he was business-like. “Look acrost the river,
Lennie, an’ I’ll tell you so you can almost see it.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p967">p967</span>Lennie turned his head and looked off across the
pool and up the darkening slopes of the Gabilans. “We
gonna get a little place,” George began. He reached in
his side pocket and brought out Carlson’s Luger; he
snapped off the safety, and the hand and gun lay on the
ground behind Lennie’s back. He looked at the back
of Lennie’s head, at the place where the spine and skull
were joined.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p968">p968</span>A man’s voice called from up the river, and another
man answered.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p969">p969</span>“Go on,” said Lennie.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p970">p970</span>George raised the gun and his hand shook, and he
dropped his hand to the ground again.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p971">p971</span>“Go on,” said Lennie. “How’s it gonna be. We
gonna get a little place.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p972">p972</span>“We’ll have a cow,” said George. “An’ we’ll have
maybe a pig an’ chickens .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an’ down the flat we’ll
have a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. little piece alfalfa——”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p973">p973</span>“For the rabbits,” Lennie shouted.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p974">p974</span>“For the rabbits,” George repeated.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p975">p975</span>“And I get to tend the rabbits.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p976">p976</span>“An’ you get to tend the rabbits.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p977">p977</span>Lennie giggled with happiness. “An’ live on the fatta
the lan’.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p978">p978</span>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p979">p979</span>Lennie turned his head.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p980">p980</span>“No, Lennie. Look down there acrost the river, like
you can almost see the place.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p981">p981</span>Lennie obeyed him. George looked down at the
gun.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p982">p982</span>There were crashing footsteps in the brush now.
George turned and looked toward them.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p983">p983</span>“Go on, George. When we gonna do it?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p984">p984</span>“Gonna do it soon.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p985">p985</span>“Me an’ you.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p986">p986</span>“You .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an’ me. Ever’body gonna be nice to you.
Ain’t gonna be no more trouble. Nobody gonna hurt
nobody nor steal from ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p987">p987</span>Lennie said, “I thought you was mad at me,
George.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p988">p988</span>“No,” said George. “No, Lennie. I ain’t mad. I
never been mad, an’ I ain’t now. That’s a thing I want
ya to know.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p989">p989</span>The voices came close now. George raised the gun
and listened to the voices.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p990">p990</span>Lennie begged, “Le’s do it now. Le’s get that place
now.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p991">p991</span>“Sure, right now. I gotta. We gotta.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p992">p992</span>And George raised the gun and steadied it, and he
brought the muzzle of it close to the back of Lennie’s
head. The hand shook violently, but his face set and
his hand steadied. He pulled the trigger. The crash of
the shot rolled up the hills and rolled down again.
Lennie jarred, and then settled slowly forward to the
sand, and he lay without quivering.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p993">p993</span>George shivered and looked at the gun, and then he
threw it from him, back up on the bank, near the pile
of old ashes.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p994">p994</span>The brush seemed filled with cries and with the
sound of running feet. Slim’s voice shouted, “George.
Where you at, George?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p995">p995</span>But George sat stiffly on the bank and looked at his
right hand that had thrown the gun away. The group
burst into the clearing, and Curley was ahead. He saw
Lennie lying on the sand. “Got him, by God.” He
went over and looked down at Lennie, and then he
looked back at George. “Right in the back of the
head,” he said softly.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p996">p996</span>Slim came directly to George and sat down beside
him, sat very close to him. “Never you mind,” said
Slim. “A guy got to sometimes.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p997">p997</span>But Carlson was standing over George. “How’d you
do it?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p998">p998</span>“I just done it,” George said tiredly.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p999">p999</span>“Did he have my gun?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p1000">p1000</span>“Yeah. He had your gun.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p1001">p1001</span>“An’ you got it away from him and you took it an’
you killed him?”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p1002">p1002</span>“Yeah. Tha’s how.” George’s voice was almost a
whisper. He looked steadily at his right hand that had
held the gun.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p1003">p1003</span>Slim twitched George’s elbow. “Come on, George.
Me an’ you’ll go in an’ get a drink.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p1004">p1004</span>George let himself be helped to his feet. “Yeah, a
drink.”</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p1005">p1005</span>Slim said, “You hadda, George. I swear you hadda.
Come on with me.” He led George into the entrance
of the trail and up toward the highway.</p>

<p><span class="counter" id="p1006">p1006</span>Curley and Carlson looked after them. And Carlson
said, “Now what the hell ya suppose is eatin’ them
two guys?”</p>
