```pre  
Excuse me  
Standing on one leg  
I'm half-caste  
  
Explain yuself  
Wha yu mean  
When yu say half-caste  
Yu mean when picasso  
Mix red an green  
Is a half-caste canvas?  
Explain yuself  
Wha u mean  
When yu say half-caste  
Yu mean when light an shadow  
Mix in de sky  
Is a half-caste weather??  
Well in dat case  
England weather  
Nearly always half-caste  
In fact some o dem cloud  
Half-caste till dem overcast  
So spiteful dem dont want de sun pass  
Ah rass  
Explain yuself  
Wha yu mean  
When yu say half-caste?  
Yu mean tchaikovsky  
Sit down at dah piano  
An mix a black key  
Wid a white key  
Is a half-caste symphony?  
Explain yuself  
Wha yu mean  
Ah listening to yu wid de keen  
Half of mih ear  
Ah looking at u wid de keen  
Half of mih eye  
And when I'm introduced to yu  
I'm sure you'll understand  
Why I offer yu half-a-hand  
An when I sleep at night  
I close half-a-eye  
Consequently when I dream  
I dream half-a-dream  
An when moon begin to glow  
I half-caste human being  
Cast half-a-shadow  
But yu come back tomorrow  
Wid de whole of yu eye  
An de whole of yu ear  
And de whole of yu mind  
  
An I will tell yu  
De other half  
Of my story  
```
