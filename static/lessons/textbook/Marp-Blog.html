<p>Since discovering Marp, I've become addicted to it. The ease, speed, clean design.</p>
<h2 id="going-live">Going Live</h2>
<p>Iframe to lock the view</p>
<p>Started with live.js and a bash script, but quite slow (and occasionally missed it)</p>
<p>Instead, setting up an API with caddy. Polling regularly (every two seconds), not really great with 30 students in a room.</p>
<p>SSE woes, using NTFY</p>
<p>Only worked on some machines, and some networks occasionally. Maddening. Even submitted bug report to Arc</p>
<p>Had a dig through the old github issues on Ntfy, turns out the call was coming from inside the CDN! Bloody cloudflare</p>
<p>Upgraded server and all working.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>Could I implement my <em>own</em> SSE server, perhaps with Golang?</p>
<p>Basic set up would be for it to push a new message to the stream whenever a watched file is changed (presumably just the one I used before with the simple URL for the current slide)</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/r3labs/sse">This looks promising for SSE</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify">And this could work for file watching</a></p>
<h2 id="the-websocket-adventure">The Websocket adventure</h2>
<p>Finally attempted to set up a Websocket system</p>
<p>Built a little server in Golang with help from Claude; worked when tested locally.</p>
<p>V tricky getting going on Caddy, even harder when coming in via Cloudflare Tunnel.</p>
<p>Eventually set up a separate subdomain for socket - on the grounds I may use it later for other projects.</p>
<p>Bizarre issue in that it would work in testing but not once stood up in a client browser. Eventually tracked down the issue: <code>ws://</code> was being used when I should have used <code>wss://</code>. What a difference an S makes.</p>
<p>Authentication is also tricky to crack. I don't want anyone sending messages on the websocket - just me - but auth headers can't be set when using WebSockets API in Javascript. General consensus seems to be that query strings <code>?=</code> are a good-enough stand in. Shall attempt to implement.</p>
