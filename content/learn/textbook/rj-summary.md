## Act 1
In the city of Verona, two noble families, the **Montagues** and the **Capulets**, are in a bitter feud. The play opens with a street fight between the servants of both families. The Prince of Verona, Escalus, intervenes and declares that further disturbances will be punished severely. Meanwhile, **Romeo Montague** is lovesick over a girl named **Rosaline**. His friends, **Benvolio** and **Mercutio**, encourage him to move on. 

At a party thrown by the **Capulets**, Romeo sneaks in with his friends. There, he meets **Juliet Capulet**. They instantly fall in love, unaware that they belong to rival families. They share a passionate kiss, but soon find out about each otherâ€™s identities, which complicates their newfound love.

## Act 2
After the party, Romeo sneaks into the **Capulet** orchard to see Juliet. They speak on her balcony and declare their love for each other, vowing to marry. The next day, with the help of **Friar Lawrence**, who hopes their union will end the feud, they secretly marry. The excitement fades when **Tybalt**, **Juliet's** hot-headed cousin, challenges Romeo to a duel for sneaking into the party. Romeo refuses to fight since he and Tybalt are now relatives by marriage.

## Act 3
Mercutio, angered by Romeo's refusal, fights Tybalt instead. Romeo tries to stop the fight, but it results in Mercutio's death. In a fit of rage, Romeo kills Tybalt and is banished from Verona by the Prince. Devastated, Romeo spends the night with Juliet before leaving. **Juliet** is heartbroken to learn of Romeo's banishment. Her parents, unaware of her secret marriage, plan to marry her off to **Paris**, a wealthy suitor.

## Act 4
To avoid the unwanted marriage, Juliet seeks Friar Lawrenceâ€™s help. He gives her a potion that will make her appear dead for 42 hours. She plans to take it, then escape to be with Romeo. Juliet drinks the potion, and her family finds her seemingly dead and buries her in the Capulet tomb. Meanwhile, Romeo, unaware of Juliet's plan, hears that she is dead and returns to Verona, heartbroken.

## Act 5
Romeo buys poison and goes to Julietâ€™s tomb to join her in death. There he encounters Paris, who is mourning Juliet. They fight, and Romeo kills Paris. He then takes the poison beside Juliet. When Juliet awakens, she sees Romeo dead beside her. Heartbroken, she tries to kiss the poison from his lips, but when that fails, she stabs herself with his dagger.

In the end, the deaths of **Romeo** and **Juliet** lead the **Montagues** and **Capulets** to reconcile and end their feud. Their tragic love story serves as a warning about the consequences of hatred and the power of love.
