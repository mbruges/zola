<p><em>by Julia Copus</em></p>
<p>Once she is halfway up there, crouched in her bikini<br>
on the porch roof of her family's house, trembling,<br>
she knows that the one thing she must not do is to think<br>
of the narrow windowsill, the sharp<br>
drop of the stairwell; she must keep her mind<br>
on the friend with whom she is half in love<br>
and who is waiting for her on the blond<br>
gravel somewhere beneath her, keep her mind<br>
on her and on the fact of the open window<br>
the flimsy, hole-punched, aluminium lever<br>
towards which in a moment she will reach<br>
with the length of her whole body, leaning in<br>
to the warm flank of the house. But first she<br>
steadies herself, still crouching, the grains of the asphalt<br>
hot beneath her toes and fingertips,<br>
a square of petrified beach. Her tiny breasts<br>
rest lightly on her thighs. ‚Äì What can she know<br>
of the way the world admits us less and less<br>
the more we grow? For now both girls seem<br>
lit, as if from within, their hair and the gold stud<br>
earrings in the first one's ears; for now the long, grey<br>
eye of the street, and far away from the mother<br>
who does not trust her daughter with a key,<br>
the workers about their business in the drab<br>
electroplating factory over the road,<br>
far too, most far, from the flush-faced secretary<br>
who, with her head full of the evening class<br>
she plans to take, or the trip of a lifetime, looks up now<br>
from the stirring omens of the astrology column<br>
at a girl ‚Äì thirteen if she's a day ‚Äì standing<br>
in next to nothing in the driveway opposite,<br>
one hand flat against her stomach, one<br>
shielding her eyes to gaze up at a pale calf,<br>
a silver anklet and the five neat shimmering-<br>
oyster-painted toenails of an outstretched foot<br>
which catch the sunlight briefly like the<br>
flash of armaments before<br>
dropping gracefully into the shade of the house.</p>
