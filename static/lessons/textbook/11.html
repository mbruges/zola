The sedge has withered from the lake,

O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,
       So haggard and so woe-begone?
The squirrelâ€™s granary is full,
       And the harvestâ€™s done.

I see a lily on thy brow,

And on thy cheeks a fading rose
       Fast withereth too.

       Full beautifulâ€”a faeryâ€™s child,
Her hair was long, her foot was light,
       And her eyes were wild.

I made a garland for her head,
       And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;
She looked at me as she did love,
       And made sweet moan

I set her on my pacing steed,
       And nothing else saw all day long,
For sidelong would she bend, and sing
       A faeryâ€™s song.

And sure in language strange she saidâ€”

She took me to her Elfin grot,
       And there she wept and sighed full sore,
And there I shut her wild wild eyes
       With kisses four.

And there she lullÃ¨d me asleep,
       And there I dreamedâ€”Ah! woe betide!â€”
The latest dream I ever dreamt
       On the cold hill side.

I saw their starved lips in the gloam,
       With horrid warning gapÃ¨d wide,
And I awoke and found me here,
       On the cold hillâ€™s side.

And this is why I sojourn here,
       Alone and palely loitering,
Though the sedge is withered from the lake,
       And no birds sing.

He has a job to do. Solutions slop in trays

A hundred agonies in black and white

From the aeroplane he stares impassively at where

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong> Walker feels <em>sorrow</em> about her father. By contrast, Thomas feels <em>a sense of anger</em>.  However, both poets are united in the fact that they are using their poems to process the loss of their fathers, and the impact that it has on them as offspring.</p>
<p><strong>1st Paragraph, STRUCTURE:</strong> We see this difference in feelings most clearly in the different structural approaches of the two poems. 'Poem at 39' follows a loose and free verse structure, with lines of varying length and inconsistent rhyme. This suggests to the reader that the poet's own internal sense of organisation and structure has been damaged by the loss of her father. <strong>By contrast,</strong> 'Do Not Go Gentle...' is far more rigid in its structure, with regular rhythm and rhyme. This could suggest how the speaker is facing the death of his father with determination and certainty, rather than allowing it to affect him.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="q2-compare-how-the-poets-present-feelings-about-fathers-in-poem-at-39-and-do-not-go-gentle-pt2">Q2) Compare how the poets present feelings about fathers in <code>Poem at 39</code> and <code>Do Not Go Gentle</code>? (pt2)</h2>
<p><strong>2nd paragraph: LANGUAGE &amp; WORD CHOICE:</strong> A similar disparity can be seen in the language and word choices of the poems. Walker chooses to use much more positive vocabulary, such as &quot;dancing&quot;: a present tense verb that has connotations of joy and celebration, which deliberately contrasts with the theme of death and mourning. This suggest the poet wishes to retain happy and positive feelings about her father, rather than mourning. Dylan's use of much more aggressive vocabulary - such as &quot;rage&quot;, &quot;curse&quot;, &quot;fierce&quot;, and &quot;burn&quot; - could suggest hellish imagery, linking to fears about life after death. &quot;Burn&quot; also suggests that the poet is being consumed by his angry feelings about his father, and that he is not in control or is processing things in the same positive way as Walker.</p>

<h2 id="q2-compare-how-the-poets-present-feelings-about-fathers-in-poem-at-39-and-do-not-go-gentle-pt3">Q2) Compare how the poets present feelings about fathers in <code>Poem at 39</code> and <code>Do Not Go Gentle</code>? (pt3)</h2>
<p><strong>3rd paragraph: COMMONALITY:</strong> Ultimately, both poems emphasise the deeply personal nature of poetic explorations of fathers. Whilst 'Poem at 39' is obviously personal from the outset, with repeated use of &quot;I&quot; and other fist person pronouns, 'Do Not Go Gentle' begins from a more declarative, imperative position, speaking directly at the reader. However, by the final stanza, Thomas too has shifted to using personal pronouns - &quot;My father... bless me&quot;. It could be argued, then, that it is impossible for a poet to speak in generic, idealised terms about fathers: even those who set out to do so initially will find themselves reflecting on and addressing their own feelings towards their own fathers.</p>
