My mother was a hanky queen  
when hanky meant a thing of cloth,  
not paper tissues bought in packs  
from late-night garages and shops,  
but things for waving out of trains  
and mopping the corners of your grief:  
when hankies were material  
sheâ€™d have one, always, up her sleeve.  
  
Tucked in the wrists of every cardi,  
a mumâ€™s embarrassment of lace  
embroidered with a V for Viv,  
spittled and scrubbed against my face.  
And sometimes more than one fell out  
as is she had a farm up there  
where dried-up hankies fell in love  
and mated, raising little squares.  
  
She bought her own; I never did.  
Hankies were presents from distant aunts  
in boxed sets, with transparent covers  
and script initials spelling ponce,  
the naffest Christmas gift youâ€™d get â€“  
my brothers too, more often than not,  
got male ones: serious, and grey,  
and larger, like they had more snot.  
It was hankies that closed department stores,  
with headscarves, girdles, knitting wool  
and trouser presses; homely props  
youâ€™d never find today in malls.  
Hankies, which demanded irons,  
and boiling to be purified  
shuttered the doors of family stores  
when those who used to buy them died.  
  
And somehow, with the hankyâ€™s loss,  
greengrocer George with his dodgy foot  
delivering veg from a Comma van  
is history, and the friendly butcher  
whoâ€™d slip an extra sausage in,  
the fishmonger whose marble slab  
of haddock smoked the colour of yolks  
and parcelled rows of local crab  
  
lay opposite the dancing school  
where Mrs White, with painted talons,  
taught us When Youâ€™re Smiling from  
a stumbling, out of tune piano:  
step-together, step-together, step-together,  
point! The Annual Talent Show  
when every mother, fencing tears,  
would whip a hanky from their sleeve  
and smudge the rouge from little dears.  
Nostalgia only makes me old.  
The innocence I want my brood  
to cling on to like ten-bob notes  
was killed in TVâ€™s lassitude.  
And it was me that turned it on and eat  
bought biscuits I would bake  
if Iâ€™d commit to being home.  
  
Thereâ€™s never a hanky up my sleeve.  
I raised neglected-looking kids,  
the kind whose noses strangers clean.  
What awkwardness in me forbids  
me to keep tissues in my bag  
when handy packs are 50p?  
I miss material handkerchiefs,  
their soft and hidden history.  
  
But it isnâ€™t mine. Iâ€™ll let it go.  
My mother too, eventually,  
who died not leaving handkerchiefs  
but tissues and uncertainty:  
and she would say, should I complain  
of the scratchy and disposable,  
that this is your material  
to do with, daughter, what you will.
