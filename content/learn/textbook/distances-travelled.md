Like many folk, when first I saddled a rucksack,  
feeling its weight on my back â€“  
the way my spine  
curved under it like a meridian â€“  
  
I thought: Yes. This is how  
to live. On the beaten track, the sherpa pass, between Krakow  
and Zagreb, or the Siberian white  
cells of scattered airports;  
  
it came clear as over a tannoy  
that in restlessness, in anony  
mity:  
was some kind of destiny.  
  
So whether it was the scare stories about Larium  
â€“ the threats of delirium  
and baldness â€“ that lead me, not to a Western Union  
wiring money with six words of Lithuanian,  
  
but to this post office with a handful of bills  
or a giro; and why, if Iâ€™m stuffing smalls  
hastily into a holdall, I am less likely  
to be catching a greyhound from Madison to Milwaukee  
  
than to be doing some overdue laundry  
is really beyond me.  
However,  
when, during routine evictions, I discover  
  
alien pants, cinema stubs, the throwaway  
comment â€“ on a postâ€“it â€“ or a tiny stowaway  
pressed flower amid bottom drawers,  
I know these are my souvenirs  
  
and, from these crushed valentines, this unravelled  
sports sock, that the furthest distances Iâ€™ve travelled  
have been those between people. And what survives  
of holidaying briefly in their lives.
