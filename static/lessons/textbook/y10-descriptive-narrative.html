<p>I got up slowly fished the alarm clock out of the bin (the poor thing's getting used
to being hurled there each morning, and headed downstairs for my usual three
bowls of cereal. My brothers eyes never left their phones, as I joined them
at the table but that was normal. It was the look on Mum's face that gave me
a clue. She was knee-deep in frowns it wasn't the most welcoming sight.
Of course then my brain started to rewind, slowly but surely, to the
previous evening's adventures. &quot;Just two or three friends, she'd warned before
heading out to her evening class &quot;okay?&quot; Two or three? Make that twelve!
But, after all, a birthday is a birthday especially a sixteenth!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The cold came to us like a thief in the night.</strong> You didn't notice it at first: it would creep in through the windows, under the doors, sneaking through gaps in the masonry. It would steal away what little warmth you still had. It would slide its icy fingers into pockets and up sleeves, taking and taking, until you realised all the heat you'd been saving had been snatched from you. No matter what defences we put up, it would always find a way to sneak in.</p>

<li>The sound of the crowd was like an orchestra...</li>
<li>The warmth of the sun spread over us like sleep...</li>
