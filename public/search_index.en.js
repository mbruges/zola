So should we be surprised when pupils reach for the AI to finish their homework, when we do the same with our paperwork?\nThe end of term is always a rush, with exams to mark, units to finish, reports to write. That last bulletpoint on the to-do list is often the most arduous: at a modest 100 words per pupil, per subject, subject teachers can soon find themselves churning out close to ten thousand words (double that if you’re a sole trader like a drama or music lead).\nFaced with a drafting a short novel in the hectic final days of an exhausting year, who can blame someone for looking to speed things up a little? Particularly when reports quickly drift into anodyne vacuity anyway (“has worked well this year… has shown progress… going forward, make more of an effort to complete homework on time…”). What’s the harm in letting the artificial brain take the strain?\nThey can always tell🔗\nSocial mores about LLM-generated text are still forming. If it’s for personal consumption, no-one can really object. But if a text purports to be from a human, tasting the tang of ChatGPT’s artificial verbage can be a bitter surprise. If it has a human’s name on it, then it should really be written by that human.\nEducators write reports in double-trust: both as custodians and as role models. The obvious purpose of the end-of-term report is to provide a (largely) unvarnished summation of how the child is doing, for the benefit of the parents. In the context of the private sector, this is even more important, perhaps the most crucial piece of client-service communcation the educator produces all year.\nBut there is the other, implicit value of the report. For the child, this is likely the only adult-coded, personally-targetted writing they will read in a year. It must set the standard for what professional, transactional writing should look like. Even if the comments are banal and inoffensive, they serve the purpose of instructing the child in how grown-ups speak to one another in a professional written context.\nTo farm that out to a bot is a dereliction of duty, and an implicit signal to child and parent that this writing doesn’t matter.\nThere are plenty of points in the school day that can benefit from the quick-and-dirty disposable drafting of AI, but the end of year report must not be one of them.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/aiforme/","title":"AI for Me, but not for Thee"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/artsvsai/":{"body":"\n\n TL;DR: The Times has been good enough to publish my letter on this topic - so just read that if you want. Otherwise: given the infinite space afforded by a personal blog, I thought it worth elaborating my thinking here.**\n\nGiven all the problems faced by British head teachers - the yawning gulf between pay and inflation, opaque inspection frameworks, cratering teacher training and retention rates - one could forgive them for choosing to focus on the current fire-fighting, rather than the looming pall of smoke on the horizon.\nWhich is why it’s even more salutary to see them turn their attention briefly - albeit in the form of an advisory body - to the question of AI in education. From The Times:\n\nA coalition of leaders of some of the country’s top schools have warned of the “very real and present hazards and dangers” being presented by AI [i.e. Large Language Models]…\nHead teachers’ fears go beyond AI’s potential to aid cheating, encompassing the impact on children’s mental and physical health and even the future of the teaching profession…\n\nThere is a lot to praise here, not least the use of the present tense. Anyone who thinks that ChatGPT isn’t already being used by students in their classroom is either naive or in denial; it’s gratifying that even the grand old man of education Sir Anthony Seldon recognises that this is something happening now, rather than something that can wait ’til the next King’s Speech.\nBut one line stood out to me (not mentioned in the coalition’s original letter, but elaborated in the subsequent Times article):\n\nThe group will create a website led by heads of science or digital at 15 state and private schools. it will offer guidance on the latest developments in AI and what schools should use and avoid.\n\nThe natural question to ask is: why these subjects specifically? I’ve not spoken with the coalition, and have little more to go on than a letter, two Times articles and some cursory Googling, but if the threat is as serious as they suggest (and it is), it is a valid question to ask.\nDancing on the razor’s edge🔗\nPerhaps I am being reductive, but there are two possible trains of thought from the coalition in focussing on science and digital.\nThe first train of thought perhaps goes something like this:\n\nLLMs are a new technology.\nScience and Digital are the subjects that produce the engineers and scientists that build these technologies.\nQ.E.D our subject specialists in those areas ought to be best placed to understand these new technologies.\n\nI have worked with some exceptional heads of science in my career: teachers capable of making the most tedious lesson on covalent bonds into a whirlwind of electron excitement.  But the skill set needed to design and deliver a science curriculum has almost zero cross-over with an understanding of cutting-edge Large Language Model research. Show me the part of the physics spec that asks a teacher to explain neural networks, or the chemistry module that analyses Tensor chip fabrication processes.\nYou may stand a little more luck if you’re a small school, with a head of ‘digital’ who doubles as head of IT, but even then: do you seriously expect them to have built a working understanding of these brand new tools, whilst still trying to fend off waves of ransomware attacks on your Windows NT-powered school mainframe?\n\n“Have you considered becoming an Apple-accredited school?”\nThe truth is, these bots are so far outside our curricula that to expect anyone on your staff to have existing expertise in them is absurd, let alone your ‘head of science or digital’ (and let’s be honest, if they were really into LLMs, do you think they’d still be hanging around on a U1 payscale? Perhaps they’d just be writing tedious blogposts instead).\nDon’t let the truth get in the way of a good tokenized response🔗\nThe second train of thought is perhaps this: Science and digital heads have subjects most closely adjacent to AI, so they will likely be the ones that see their subjects affected the most.\nBut to think this way is to miss the whole point of ChatGPT and other chatbots. They are designed to write prose, not formulae or scientific analyses. Precision, accuracy, and truthfulness are not the priority here, fluency is.\nIt’s hard to wrap one’s head around this, because it runs contrary to the way computers are supposed to work. For decades, we’ve known them as glorified calculators, capable of exact detail, but not the nuances of human speech and art. Machines for truth, not beauty.\nNow, for the first time, we have a technology that does the very opposite. This is not a gradually, iterative change to computing, but a radical and fundamental, paradigmatic shift. You may access ChatGPT from your browser, and type into it like you would Google, but it is a wholly different technology with a wholly different purpose.\nAs I’ve put it more succinctly here:\n\nWhat makes these new large language models such as ChatGPT so exceptional is their ability to produce fluent and plausible prose: they are far better suited to writing essays on Coleridge than calculating covalent bonds. It is the literature student who reaches for AI first, not the chemist.\n\nWith all this in mind, the decision to focus on Science and Digital departments suggests a lack of understanding of the nature of the technology, or indeed the dangers posed.\nTidy prose, tidy mind🔗\nSo who should be involved?\nWell, I am a little biased, but if prose is the name of the game, then English (and our cousins in the Humanities) ought to be top of the list. Implicitly, we use the requirement of prose as a proxy for thought. Fluent essays aren’t rewarded just because they sound nice, but because they act as a symptom of organised, complex thinking.\nEnglish Literature and Language are, perhaps, most at risk here. Ours is the subject least rooted in the concrete and factual (beyond plot-points and grammatical rules), and most centred around nebulous and subjective ideas of style and structure. The best English students are those that read the most, and the bots have read everything.\nWe now have a technology that can easily surmount the once wholly-human task of producing a passable essay; not simply paraphrasing an existing one, but making something entirely new and untraceable. The barrier to entry for machines has been comprehensively vaulted over. How we re-establish that barrier, how (or if) we build a new proxy mechanism for measuring complexity of thought is another matter, and one the margins here won’t contain.\nBut in the immediate: speak to your heads of English, Humanities and Arts. Either they’re already nervous of what’s to come, or they ought to be. They will be on the front-line of this LLM-powered revolution, so help them build their barricades.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/artsvsai/","title":"AI will eat your English Department"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/bangoogle/":{"body":"\nWe can’t control the tides, but we can at least stop our students playing on the sandbars\nIt seems incredible to say now, but I once received lessons in How To Google. And yesterday, Google rang the death-knell for that way of traditional searching.\nFriday was Google’s annual I/O conference. Between the perennial updates to mobiles and tablets was arguably the most important innovation in search since PageRank: the opening up of their chatbot ‘Bard’, and the move to place it front and centre on the search results page.\nIt is fast, free, and extremely capable. And if we are not careful, it will destroy the way students use the Internet.\nAn uneasy alliance🔗\nThe relationship between teachers and the search-box has always been fraught.\nThose old Google lessons on chuntering Pentium PCs were not just one-offs, they had whole carefully designed schemes of work about search operators, link assessing, citations, etcetera.\nMy dutiful I.C.T. teachers had grown up without the Internet: they were equal parts wary and awed by the power of this new ‘engine for search’. They - rightly - saw it for the fire-hose of information that it was, and recognised that students needed to be carefully introduced to the ‘right’ way to operate this powerful machine.\nWithout the proper training, it’ll drive you off an intellectual cliff, into a ravine of misinformation and misunderstanding. So each Thursday after lunch we sat in the computer lab, carefully typing search strings into the plain white box, scrolling down the page of blue linked search results.\n\nAn image from a happier time, when man and machine lived in perfect harmony and stock image providers were completely deranged.\nThose lessons mattered because our teachers knew that, given half a chance, we’d simply click the first result we were given.\nIn this caution, however, lies the academic utility of Google: it was a librarian, pointing you towards sources of information; it was up to you to read, evaluate and extricate the information you needed from those sources. There’s a strong argument to be made that the ‘Google’ generation developed those essential academic skills of citation and synthesis far more quickly than previous, non-digitised students, simply by dint of having to wade through so many more potential sources. Skim-reading ten different webpages on the same topic is not a waste of time by any means, it’s the very point of being a scholar: to become immersed in the intellectual milieu of a subject, gradually forming one’s own unique perspective.\nNow, I’m not so Panglossian as to suggest that all students, all the time, for all their work, used Google in this inquisitive, critical way. The point is that they could. With the right encouragement and scaffolding (and plagiarism vigilance) from their teachers, students could use Google as the incredible information democratiser that it was built to be.\nGoogle’s mission is to “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”.  When handled with care, that purpose (specifically its first clause) made Google the most powerful tool in a student’s arsenal: laying a pathway to the answers they needed, but still requiring students to think to get the answer itself.\nBut that is no longer the case.\nZero-clicks, zero thought🔗\nThis is nothing new. Slowly, over the past decade, Google has been chipping away at that second clause: the “accessible and useful” part. Filtering through search results - for all its value as a learning exercise, is not “accessible.” Google’s expressed intention over the past few years has been to obfuscate that familiar list of blue links, turning from librarian to oracle.\nRich snippets and cards were one of the first attempts to turn search away from indexing sources of information to answering users’ queries directly. Rather than giving prominence at the top of the search page to the most relevant web pages, result cards snipped out what the algorithm decided was the relevant information, and plonked it directly in front of the searcher’s eyeballs.\n\nThis is a rich snippet. Note that this still has a link - a digital paper trail for the diligent student to follow, evaluate and cite.\nIt’s a subtle shift, but one that marks a fundamental change in how we interact with search engines.  It stops Google being a repository of potential answers - laid out for your to assess for yourself, as a scholar - to simply being the sole source of information in and of itself.  This is the dream of ‘zero-click search’.\nFriday’s announcement marks the next evolution of this philosophy, and it is far more troubling.\nThe ‘new generative search’ results page showcased by Google places AI-generated content at the very top: ahead of the traditional blue hyperlinks.\nWhereas result cards at least had the decency to pull their information from a tangible source (with a link to read more if you were so inclined), the New Search aims to do away with the whole concept of ‘the source’.  Through their LLM-power chatbot ‘Bard’, the Google will now generate brand new text to answer your query; text without a digital paper-trail, created through an opaque synthesisation of all the web’s writing.\nIt is no longer a ‘search engine’, but an answer engine.\n\n…and this is a ‘Bard’ response. No link, no citation, no paper trail: just pure unfiltered Information. There’s still a desultory ‘Google It’ button, of course, because how else will they pay for it?\nI’m feeling unlucky🔗\nAnd the problem is: it will work. The answers provided will be (already are) lucid and convincing and good enough for the casual searcher. Because each response is generated, not indexed, it will also be next-to-impossible to detect as plagiarism. The usual reassurances have been given, but it’s an open secret that LLM-detection software is barely better than random.\nThere is no value to be found - not for schools, not for students - in a tool that simply gives answers. School is not about returning the right answer. Education is not about the tick-marks. Every perfect score isn’t a sign of success, it’s a marker of insufficient challenge and poorly scaled learning.\n\n“Well done! You copied and pasted the answer I gave you. Here: have a Bachelors.”\nAll this new product offers is danger; the danger that comes from automating and outsourcing the most important aspect of learning: getting things wrong and navigating the pathway to right-ness.\nImperfection is needed to trigger the learning journey, to enable thought. This idea is anathema to Google. Search will only ever move in one direction: whichever way removes the friction between user and product. ‘Thinking’ is just another piece of friction, grit in the gears of their well-oiled advertising machine.\nSo it falls to schools to take the step and recognise what is coming. And it needs to happen today, before our students become completely dependent on the incredible, infallible answer engine.\nWe can only pray for the return of the king.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/bangoogle/","title":"The case for banning Google"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/codingonthetitanic/":{"body":"\nLess “rearranging the deckchairs” and more “putting on your white tie, sitting down in the flooded dining room and wondering if there’ll be scallops to start.”\nYou can’t move for the doom-laden coding headlines at the moment:\n\nThe layoffs are here for those who chose to ‘learn to code’\nMeta layoffs show how coding jobs are no longer safe\nWill A.I. Steal All The Code And Take All The Jobs?\n\n(And given what they’ve gone through, one should really allow the media precariat this little crumb of schadenfreude.)\nSo why on earth would you waste your precious youth learning to code now?\nThe paradox of it is that even in the teeth of this apocalypse, there’s never been an easier time to learn to code. Nor a time when it’s been as frictionless and fun. And it’s precisely because of The Bots that this is the case.\nTo err is human, to post is divine🔗\nSince the year zero, learning computer-whispering has been a process of standing on the shoulders of prat-fallen giants.\nIt’s a noble tradition, founded on the principle of mining the mistakes of others for the knowledge you need, scouring long-dead Stackoverflow/ Reddit/ message-board threads to find the poor sod who had the identical error code to you, but back in April 2004 on a computer that looked like a cow.\nI cannot count the number of times - callow-eyed youth as I was - that I almost bricked my Eee PC, blindly copying and pasting console commands from some poorly-translated Estonian Xandros forum, only to have its 7-inch display splutter back into life thanks to the garbled incantations on page 94 of another obscure Estonian distro forum.\nAnd this is by design! This is how computing works! Piece by obscure piece, the corpus, the Canon, has been built by often-nameless men and women in computer labs and basements  and Nebraska. And if you want to learn it properly, sometimes you’ve got to go to the source.\n\nIt’s like the Academy, except Plato is some anonymous Eastern European computer science student with a profile pic of Shadow the Hedgehog\nDrinking from the hosepipe🔗\nSo what’s different now? Well: The Bots.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly - and as a clear vindication of the ‘Relentless Googling’ school of pedagogy - they have been doing exactly the same thing. Day in, day out, they’ve been doom-scrolling. And they’ve already digested every single one of those haunted forum posts, manically hoovering it all up in the name of training data before The Man shuts off the API fire-hose.\nObviously, Bots Are Liars Sometimes. Even the really expensive ones.  But that’s only a problem if you treat it as a search engine, a machine for delivering Truth (and even then: come on, didn’t you have the ‘Beware of Google’ lesson in Year 6 ICT?).\nInstead, treat it as what it is: a hideous amalgamated chimera of every midnight scream into the digital void, and every echo - helpful and unhelpful - that came to The Poster’s aid. The Forum is never right the first time (not unless your problem is extremely obvious, as people will politely remind you). It is in the sifting and panning for gold that we really learn, with the latent threat of Bricking From Blind Copying providing just enough jeopardy to give you meaningful pause to reflect. Neither should we expect The Bot, then, to be an ever-reliable truth-giver.\nBut what The Bot is capable of - what it excels at - is giving you an endless stream of vaguely helpful, possibly correct-sounding suggestions that might get you the solution to your problem. Or better yet, for our purposes: they’ll nudge into thinking along the right lines.\n‘Dig your own grave and save!’🔗\nOf course, the bullish case is to say the bots can already code. And I’ve no doubt at all that they can do it far better than I can, even if their errors are more hallucinatory than mine (but have they got a rich and detailed search history that includes one hundred variations of why async not work please help? I think not).\nBut to say that is to miss the point. I won’t rehash the argument about the purpose of hand-making that which can be machine-produced: I’m about three hundred years late for that one. Nor could these margins contain a worthwhile expounding on the value of creativity in the age of generative content, if only because others have made the case far more eloquently already.\nBut I will happily argue that Learning Is Good, and anything that helps you learn must be good by proxy. It is my day-job, after all.\nLike any tool: The Bot is only as good as the purpose you put it to. And I cannot think of a better, more worthwhile exercise than learning a new skill that stretches a part of your brain that otherwise sits untouched and atrophying, bar the occasional stab of a ‘Fiendish’ sudoku.\nSo use The Bots. Have no shame. Just don’t brick yourself by blindly copying what they’ve told you.\nAnd if you do: time to learn Estonian. 🇪🇪\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/codingonthetitanic/","title":"Coding on The Titanic"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/filtered-unfiltered/":{"body":"\nThis Hacker News comment started turning a cog in my brain: are we going about LLMs all wrong, by plonking them straight in the hands of the end user?\n\nI’m of the mind that AI, in it’s current state, really isn’t a tool meant for an end user to interact with.\nIt feels like it’s the most useful when it’s transparent and you – as an end user – don’t know that there’s an LLM in the process.

Obviously, we don’t want students to do this; it’s just plagiarism with fewer steps. But we’ve got a doubled-up problem of unfiltered LLM output here: no wrapper means the bot can go buck-wild with its answer, and no work-ethic/morals/care from the student means minimal error-checking on their end.\nWe live in a world where this happens anyway, and Google isn’t getting banned anytime soon.\nBut what if we could nudge them towards a filtered version of the bot, one that doesn’t introduce quite as much random nonsense, and - God help us! - potentially nudges them towards some actual learning?\nSentenced to life🔗\nIn my wonderful fantasy world, our students - when given an essay homework[1] - reach not for the raw chatbox but our carefully prepped light wrapper. Let’s call it Kickstart.\nThey plonk in their homework task as before, though rather than the LLM spitting out a full essay, it returns something a little more carefully considered: sentence starters and ideas for what to write.\nKickstart isn’t going to write their essay for them, but what it will do is get them going, overcoming the initial activation energy of thought.\nSentence starters are often the most effective form of scaffolding we can employ, tricking the brain into working a little like an LLM to test out what it thinks might be the right answer.\nAnd what they end up writing might be wrong, but that’s fine! Because they’re little learning humans, not inscrutable monolithic software stacks allocating life-saving care.\nA man can dream🔗\nOf course, this is a fantasy, and what reason do they have to reach for Kickstart rather than openai.com?\nThat being said, the path of least resistance is a powerful thing. Couple this with a tougher line on AI-generated plagiarism (and better training for staff on how to spot it), and one could nudge a few into using LLMs the right way, the way any technology is supposed to be used: as an augmentation - not replacement - for your brain.\n\n\nAlthough we all know this isn’t what homework is for.

It’s an incredible career, and one I’m proud to be part of.\nBut a niggling feeling started to at the back of my mind a few months ago.\nTeachers don’t do much learning.\nThat’s perhaps unfair - hardly anyone, really, does much learning past the age of 25. I don’t mean in the self-knowledge, incremental gains kind of way; I mean in the taking on of a fundamentally new skill or new domain, something you don’t already do.\nCertainly, we sit through plenty of CPD (of varying quality). But this is often either something we know already, something we’ve forgotten and need to be (legally) reminded of on a periodic basis, or some system that changes something we were doing already.\nThe rarity of genuinely new experiences is, I think, one of the things that hampers us from truly understanding the mind-bendingly difficult process our students go through 5 times a day, every day: being confronted with something you don’t know yet, and being unsure quite how you’ll ever get to the stage of fully understanding it.\nIt’s remarkable, really. It’s as though we experience collective amnesia about those horrendous few terms in Year 9 when first confronted with algebraic equations, or that torturous double period on a Thursday as a well-meaning madame patiently explained the past participle for the soixante-dix time. As though we’ve agreed to never speak of them again, and certainly not re-live the emotions.\nBut ever a glutton for punishment, I have thrown myself back into the unforgiving maw of learning, willingly.\nThis website you’re on right now - in all its hacked-together glory  - represents the half-ripened fruits of that process.\nFit your own lightbulbs🔗\nMy first, and over-riding feeling? Satisfaction. My god is it satisfying to get something, to go from clueless to clue-full. In that one brief moment (before you see the Dunning-Kruger pit gaping ahead of you) the fabric of space and time opens up and you are master of the universe. You have, through your own fleshy grey matter, taken something that was meaningless and rendered it meaningful. Where that was darkness, light; where there was fear, understanding.\nThe second feeling, hot on satisfaction’s heels: worry. Because one must then ask the question: how often do my students feel this? This burning, satisfied pride that comes from accumulating another brick of knowledge on their little pyramid of progress? Do they ever? Do I celebrate it when I see it? Can I see it?\nWhen interviewing teachers, one of the most best questions you can ask is: what’s been your favourite moment in the classroom? Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, the answer will be this. The ‘light-bulb’ moment of understanding, going off in the student (usually recalcitrant, usually male), which briefly illuminates the narrow path ahead of them and makes it seem achievable.\nPerhaps we can all benefit from living a moment like this ourselves. Fit your own lightbulbs; remember what it feels like.\nJust do it ✔️🔗\nThe best way to learn is to do. One can read, highlight, bulletpoint, mind-map in a beautifully Pinterest-able notebook, but if you want to form and solidifying those synaptic connections, you need to actually practice. And practice that produces something is even better.\nKnowing that anyone with a Wi-Fi connection and a browser can access what you show is another excellent motivator.\nHaving faffed around with Javascript and a little Python, there’s a great deal to be said for solidifying the nebulous world of monospaced type on a black screen into something more tangible and designed.\nThis site is less a showcase or portfolio, and more a sketchbook. There are lots of ideas here in various states of completion. Some are demos at 99% functionality, some are projects I’ve put on ice for the foreseeable, and some are abominations of half-formed code that really ought to be put out of their misery.\nBut each one represents one of those lightbulbs.

I’ve tested out a few - some silly, some deadly serious, and some making use of my day-job pedagogy to channel the Magic Talking Computers into something useful.\nOne question, one answer🔗\nBut the best application I’ve built - the one I use every day, a dozen times a day (and the reason OpenAI and Anthropic have my credit card details) - is easily the simplest.\nSometimes, you just want the computer to do The Thing; to turn your fleshy human thoughts into clean coded commands.

It’s cut my StackOverflow and Arch Wiki lurking time in half.

Students will often be thrown into the blazing white .docx  quadrangle before they have even the most basic understanding of computers, drafting, or the formalities of writing.  They can be overwhelmed by the profundity of formatting options - the colours, the WordArt, the clipart (oh God, the clipart) - so much so that the words themselves seem less important.\n\nWhat a thing of beauty.\nAnd who can blame them? Formatting is fun! Unlike crafting prose, the feedback loop is instantaneous, the results immediately visible. Click this button and look: it’s bigger! There’s no equivalent for writing, no “click here to increase pathos by 20%.” At least, not yet. There isn’t a primary teacher in the world who hasn’t let their students work on computers for a lesson, only for the hour to produce nothing more than 30 documents with a single, brightly coloured heading of My StOrY.\nMan cannot live by Format-&gt;Font alone🔗\nFormatting is lower-order thought. It may be creative, but it is not generative. It is not the valuable part.\nVisit any consultancy or agency producing reports and decks for a living and I will guarantee that billable rates scale inversely to the amount of time an individual personally spends fiddling with column layouts and transparency effects. Those at the very top can live in a workflow of bluntly worded emails and WhatsApp voicenotes.\nWhy? Because content is the valuable part, not the colour.\n\nYou may not like it, but this is what peak creativity looks like.\nIf that’s the case, when we really need to write, why use tools that distract us from the core purpose?\nWriting requires discipline. And you can only have your pudding once you’ve written (?) your meat. In releasing students into the all-you-can-format buffet of Word.exe, we let them gorge on sweet treats of colouring and shuffling, whilst skipping the chewy fibre of actual writing.\nMore with less🔗\nSo how should we begin? How do we put down the first word and start the flow of writing?\nLike any chemical reaction, tweaking the environment helps: something to lower the activation energy and get the words bonding into sentences. Increase the temperature, the pressure, and the collisions increase. The same with writing.\nIt’s well-documented how the limiting of options paradoxically enhances creativity. Tell a child to write a story about anything they want, any way they want, and it will be slow going. Tell them to describe their morning without any words that use the letter A, and suddenly it is a challenge they can throw themselves into.\nDon’t bash the ‘#’🔗\nBy setting boundaries on the creative process, we can channel ourselves more easily into actually producing something. This is why it’s one of the great crimes of digitised education that we’ve attached so much importance to fully-featured word processors. They’re designed for desktop publishing, not for writing. If raw prose is the proxy for thought, all those shiny formatting buttons are nothing but distractions at best, and strains on the cognitive load at worst.\nThis is where Markdown comes in. Basic formatting exists, certainly, but it is there to structure your writing and thinking. The point-size, underline style, colour of your heading? Don’t worry about that. Just know your heading is there and focus on the words underneath it.\nThat hour in the computer lab spent fiddling with titles? Now it just looks like this:\n\nThat’s it.\nThe restriction of your options to a limited few (headings, italics, bold, etc) keeps Formatting where it belongs - down at the bottom of Bloom’s pyramid - while you scale the heady heights and actually write.\nSo try it.

But I do not love BBC Sounds.\nIt is clunky, it lacks automatic downloads, and it has an unbearable habit of advertising the podcast you are listening to during said podcast, with a bonus reminder that you can listen to the podcast on the app you are currently using.\nAs more and more BBC programmes vanish from open podcast platforms and into Sounds, the app feels increasingly like an attempt to build a content silo that is utterly unbecoming of a national broadcaster.\nAnd yet: a licence-fee-payer has got to get his pips. But how?\nTime to make our own Six O’Clock News Podcast, with auto-downloads, FM-quality bongs and no Sounds announcements.\nCrossing the streams🔗\nBack in the heady days of internet radio, Auntie gifted the world high-quality audio streams of all BBC radio stations. Sadly, these have started to disappear, though a few diehards still maintain lists of the working streams.\nI won’t post the streams here, but if you’re interested I would recommend visiting the Github and trying your luck.\n\n These streams - and the steps discussed here - are strictly for personal use. As much as I find BBC Sounds objectionable and irritating, pirating BBC content is Not OK.\n\n.m3u8 to .m4a🔗\nNow we have our stream, we need to capture it.\nThere are a few bespoke programs in the repos for capturing streams, but we’re going to stick with the trusty workhorse of FFMPEG, for simplicity’s sake (it’s a quick apt-get, or brew install for Mac).\nWe pipe our stream in to FFMPEG, specify an output file, and it’ll record away.\n\nGreat! But I don’t particularly want an endless MP3 file of Radio 4, or I may accidentally listen to Moneybox.\nSo, we set a flag to limit the recording to 30 minutes. While we’re at it, we’ll also set a bitrate - without this, we can easily end up with a file size into the hundred of MBs - and switch to our preferred format of .m4a, using -c:a aac. A bitrate of 128k is more than sufficient for our purposes.\nOur command now looks like this:\n\nBut a strange thing happens if you set this to run: after about 7 to 8 minutes, the recording will stop. With much painful debugging (-loglevel is your friend), the answer appears: the encoder is catching up with the end of the stream. When it does, it stops, satisfied with a job well done.\nSo, we need to add a couple more flags to let FFMPEG know that this is a live stream, and to keep going until our timer is up: -re. We can also add -itsoffset to give some breathing room between the encoding and the stream, as well as a -reconnect and an expanded buffer just to be safe. Our final command, then, is:\n\nSave the command down into a handy script - something like get-news.sh - then set a cronjob to run it at 6pm every day: 0 18 * * * bash get-news.sh. Obviously, you’ll need your computer to be switched on for the duration of the recording. FFMPEG is light enough that it can easily run on a Pi: as good an excuse as any to dig it out from the drawer.\n\n The streams tend to have a delay of 20-30 secs on them, so it’s worth adding in a sleep 15 at beginning of the script to account for this.\n\nServing the podcast🔗\n\n Syncthing is super-easy to set up. Give it a go!\n\nAs a quick and dirty way to get the files onto a phone for listening, Syncthing works perfectly; set it up to watch the folder containing the podcast audio files, and make sure Syncthing on the device is set up to receive them.\nMy preferred listening app is AntennaPod: open-source and very snappy. For our purposes, it also has an easy method for adding local files: tap Add podcast then Add local folder to select the Syncthing folder containing the audio files. As soon as the files appear in the folder, they’ll populate into your Episode feed (with the added bonus of being listenable offline).\n\nAnd voila: your own, FM-standard, Sounds-free 6 O’Clock News, with auto-downloads, immediately after broadcast. Just as Lord Reith intended.\n\n“…in view of the widespread interest which is taken by Our People in\nservices which provide audio and visual material by means of broadcasting, the internet or the use of newer technologies, and of the great value of such services as means of disseminating information, education and entertainment…”\n\nRoyal Charter for the BBC, 2016\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/private-podcasts/","title":"Turning radio into podcasts"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/test/":{"body":"This is just a test page, please ignore. 😇\nCheckboxes🔗\n\n\nnormal\n\ncheckboxes\n\nticked\n\nnot ticked\n\nticked and strikethrough\n\n\n\nThis is a caution.\n\n\n\nThis is a note.\n\n\n\nThis is a think.\n\n\nThis is a quote\nThis is another line of the quote\nThis line has double space at the end\n…so this ought to be a new line.\n\nby Me\n\n\nDid it work?\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/test/","title":"Test Page"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/trial-by-error/":{"body":"\nA trial by ordeal\nThis website is a place about learning and a place for learning: as the playground page testifies, this is as much a learning experience for me as it is a resource for anyone else.\nBased on my previous musings, I’ve tried to put the principle into practice. Allow me to introduce my latest experiment in GPT and JS:\nWhat Am I Doing Wrong?\n\nSimply put: it’s a wrapper for ChatGPT that gives you feedback on your code. Philosophically, it’s a deliberate nudge away from the “fire-and-forget” approach to LLMs that their design (and decades of Google habits) tend towards. Rather than demand “make me a script to do this thing” (which The Bot is perfectly capable of doing!), this puts the impetus on the user to attempt the problem first, before seeking the help of the omniscient chatbot overlord.\nCreating is hard, editing is easy🔗\n“What am I doing wrong?” (or WAIDW, for short) is probably the most powerful question a learner can ask.\nIt invites effective feedback, sets a clear metric of success, and scaffolds its own response. Telling a student what a ‘good one looks like’ seems simple, but is extremely tricky to get right: end-products don’t often foreground the most important thinking, and copying the model might mean the learner ends up focusing your efforts on what doesn’t really matter.\n\nTracing ‘The Last Supper’ won’t make you a master of perspective overnight - you need to understand the fundamentals\n“WAIDW”, on the other hand, is simple to answer for anyone with domain knowledge one step above the questioner. If you know more than they do, you can’t help but identify the gaps in knowledge, and offer the immediate remedy. Call it Weaponised Mansplaining; the Pedagogy of The Insufferable; the Art of Ackshually.\nIt also forces you, as a teacher, to focus your speech on the needs of the learner. ‘Teacher talk’ is a trap, particularly when it isn’t dialogic. WAIDR is the perfect prompt to force even the most didactic of instructors, judo-like, to flip their desire for monologuing into an act of student-centred learning.\nCheck yourself before you brick yourself🔗\nSo where does this fit with the new experiment?\nWell: The Bot is clever, but it’s not got enough tokens to go full Vygotsky or Bloom on you just yet. But what it can do, very effectively, is auto-correct. And essentially, that’s what “WAIDW” is for the human brain: here’s how I’ve started, now give me some wiggly red lines and tell me what to fix.\nOf course, we don’t want to fall into the trap of blind-copying the correction that’s been given. I’ve got a perfectly good ‘click to copy’ function (thank you very much), and an earlier draft of this site had it implemented: snipping out the code to the clipboard, all set for oven-ready deployment to your failing script.\nTaking that little button out is another small nudge towards the pause-reflect-digest cycle that one needs to actually learn from a mistake.\n\nMe typing sudo bash for the first time.\nI’ve joked before about the dangers of ‘bricking’ - irreparably breaking something by copying what you don’t understand - but it’s a potent metaphor. Too often, as teachers, we incentivise the “do as I do” approach, and mistake mirrored compliance for actual understanding. In the worst case, our students end up building their knowledge on non-existent foundations, before some unscaffolded, unmodelled assessment suddenly liquifies the ground and it all comes tumbling down.\nIf that happens, the loss of confidence can be catastrophic, and the closest to ‘bricking’ that a learner can get.  The process of rebuilding has to start with working out where the uncomprehending copying ends, and where the solid knowledge begins. And to get there, we start asking “What Am I Doing Wrong?”\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/trial-by-error/","title":"Trial by Error"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/experiments/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/experiments/","title":"Experiments"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/experiments/funny/":{"body":"\nTell me a joke\n\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/experiments/funny/","title":"Funny Bot"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/experiments/roll/":{"body":"\nROLL\nYou rolled a:\n\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/experiments/roll/","title":"Roll the Dice"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/learn/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/learn/","title":"learn"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/about/":{"body":115,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":0,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/aiforme/":{"body":221,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/artsvsai/":{"body":621,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/bangoogle/":{"body":656,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/codingonthetitanic/":{"body":449,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/filtered-unfiltered/":{"body":317,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/helloworld/":{"body":381,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/howdoi/":{"body":245,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/markdown/":{"body":354,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/private-podcasts/":{"body":421,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/test/":{"body":26,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/trial-by-error/":{"body":345,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/experiments/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/experiments/funny/":{"body":2,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/experiments/roll/":{"body":2,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/learn/":{"body":0,"title":1}},"length":18},"lang":"English"}
