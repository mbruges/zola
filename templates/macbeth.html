This is the sergeant<br/>
Who, like a good and hardy soldier, fought<br/>

Say to the King the knowledge of the broil<br/>
As thou didst leave it.
</p>

<p class="drama">
SOLDIER.<br/>
Doubtful it stood;<br/>
As two spent swimmers that do cling together<br/>
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald<br/>
(Worthy to be a rebel, for to that<br/>
The multiplying villainies of nature<br/>
Do swarm upon him) from the Western Isles<br/>
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;<br/>
And Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,<br/>
Show’d like a rebel’s whore. But all’s too weak;<br/>
For brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name),<br/>
Disdaining Fortune, with his brandish’d steel,<br/>
Which smok’d with bloody execution,<br/>
Like Valour’s minion, carv’d out his passage,<br/>
Till he fac’d the slave;<br/>
Which ne’er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,<br/>
Till he unseam’d him from the nave to the chops,<br/>
And fix’d his head upon our battlements.

No sooner justice had, with valour arm’d,<br/>
Compell’d these skipping kerns to trust their heels,<br/>
But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,<br/>
With furbish’d arms and new supplies of men,<br/>
Began a fresh assault.

Yes;<br/>
As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.<br/>

Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:<br/>
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,<br/>
Or memorize another Golgotha,<br/>
I cannot tell—<br/>
But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.

From Fife, great King,<br/>
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky<br/>
And fan our people cold.<br/>
Norway himself, with terrible numbers,<br/>
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,<br/>
The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;<br/>
Till that Bellona’s bridegroom, lapp’d in proof,<br/>
Confronted him with self-comparisons,<br/>
Point against point, rebellious arm ’gainst arm,<br/>
Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,<br/>
The victory fell on us.

“They met me in the day of success; and I have learned by the
perfect’st report they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When I
burned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which
they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the
King, who all-hailed me, ‘Thane of Cawdor’; by which title, before,
these Weird Sisters saluted me, and referred me to the coming on of time, with
‘Hail, king that shalt be!’ This have I thought good to deliver
thee (my dearest partner of greatness) that thou might’st not lose the
dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what greatness is promis’d thee.
Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.”

And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou’dst have, great Glamis,<br/>
That which cries, “Thus thou must do,” if thou have it;<br/>

Than wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither,<br/>

PORTER.<br/>
Here’s a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of hell gate, he should
have old turning the key. [<i>Knocking.</i>] Knock, knock, knock. Who’s
there, i’ th’ name of Belzebub? Here’s a farmer that hanged
himself on the expectation of plenty: come in time; have napkins enow about
you; here you’ll sweat for’t. [<i>Knocking.</i>] Knock, knock!
Who’s there, i’ th’ other devil’s name? Faith,
here’s an equivocator, that could swear in both the scales against either
scale, who committed treason enough for God’s sake, yet could not
equivocate to heaven: O, come in, equivocator. [<i>Knocking.</i>] Knock, knock,
knock! Who’s there? Faith, here’s an English tailor come hither,
for stealing out of a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may roast your
goose. [<i>Knocking.</i>] Knock, knock. Never at quiet! What are you?—But
this place is too cold for hell. I’ll devil-porter it no further: I had
thought to have let in some of all professions, that go the primrose way to
th’ everlasting bonfire. [<i>Knocking.</i>] Anon, anon! I pray you,
remember the porter.

That you do lie so late?

PORTER.<br/>
Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and drink, sir, is a great
provoker of three things.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MACDUFF.<br/>
What three things does drink especially provoke?
</p>

<p class="drama">
PORTER.<br/>
Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes and
unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance.
Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery: it makes
him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,
and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and not stand to; in conclusion,
equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him the lie, leaves him.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MACDUFF.<br/>
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
</p>

<p class="drama">
PORTER.<br/>
That it did, sir, i’ the very throat on me; but I requited him for his
lie; and (I think) being too strong for him, though he took up my legs
sometime, yet I made a shift to cast him.

I will advise you where to plant yourselves,<br/>

That I require a clearness. And with him<br/>
(To leave no rubs nor botches in the work)<br/>

Whose absence is no less material to me<br/>

Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart.<br/>

Both the worlds suffer,<br/>
Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep<br/>
In the affliction of these terrible dreams<br/>
That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,<br/>
Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,<br/>
Than on the torture of the mind to lie<br/>
In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;<br/>
After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well;<br/>

Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,<br/>
And make our faces vizards to our hearts,<br/>
Disguising what they are.

But in them nature’s copy’s not eterne.

Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown<br/>
His cloister’d flight, ere to black Hecate’s summons<br/>
The shard-born beetle, with his drowsy hums,<br/>
Hath rung night’s yawning peal, there shall be done<br/>
A deed of dreadful note.

<p class="drama">
LADY MACBETH.<br/>
What’s to be done?
</p>

Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,<br/>
And with thy bloody and invisible hand<br/>
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond<br/>
Which keeps me pale!—Light thickens; and the crow<br/>
Makes wing to th’ rooky wood.<br/>
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,<br/>
Whiles night’s black agents to their preys do rouse.<br/>
Thou marvell’st at my words: but hold thee still;<br/>
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.<br/>
So, pr’ythee, go with me.

My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,<br/>
Which can interpret farther: only, I say,<br/>
Thing’s have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan<br/>
Was pitied of Macbeth:—marry, he was dead:—<br/>
And the right valiant Banquo walk’d too late;<br/>
Whom, you may say, if’t please you, Fleance kill’d,<br/>
For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.<br/>
Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous<br/>
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain<br/>
To kill their gracious father? damned fact!<br/>
How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight,<br/>
In pious rage, the two delinquents tear<br/>
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?<br/>
Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;<br/>
For ’twould have anger’d any heart alive,<br/>
To hear the men deny’t. So that, I say,<br/>
He has borne all things well: and I do think,<br/>
That had he Duncan’s sons under his key<br/>
(As, and’t please heaven, he shall not) they should find<br/>
What ’twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.<br/>
But, peace!—for from broad words, and ’cause he fail’d<br/>
His presence at the tyrant’s feast, I hear,<br/>
Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell<br/>
Where he bestows himself?
</p>

<p class="drama">
LORD.<br/>
The son of Duncan,<br/>
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,<br/>
Lives in the English court and is receiv’d<br/>
Of the most pious Edward with such grace<br/>
That the malevolence of fortune nothing<br/>
Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff<br/>
Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid<br/>
To wake Northumberland, and warlike Siward<br/>
That, by the help of these (with Him above<br/>
To ratify the work), we may again<br/>
Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights;<br/>
Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,<br/>
Do faithful homage, and receive free honours,<br/>
All which we pine for now. And this report<br/>

May soon return to this our suffering country<br/>

Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,<br/>

The most diminutive of birds, will fight,<br/>

The fits o’ th’ season. I dare not speak much further:<br/>
But cruel are the times, when we are traitors,<br/>
And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumour<br/>
From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,<br/>

This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,<br/>
Was once thought honest: you have loved him well;<br/>
He hath not touch’d you yet. I am young; but something<br/>

Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,<br/>
Yet grace must still look so.

And the rich East to boot.

Be not offended:<br/>
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.<br/>

There would be hands uplifted in my right;<br/>
And here, from gracious England, have I offer<br/>
Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,<br/>
When I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head,<br/>

I grant him bloody,<br/>
Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,<br/>
Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin<br/>
That has a name: but there’s no bottom, none,<br/>
In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,<br/>
Your matrons, and your maids, could not fill up<br/>
The cistern of my lust; and my desire<br/>

Boundless intemperance<br/>

And fall of many kings. But fear not yet<br/>
To take upon you what is yours: you may<br/>
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,<br/>
And yet seem cold—the time you may so hoodwink.<br/>
We have willing dames enough; there cannot be<br/>
That vulture in you, to devour so many<br/>
As will to greatness dedicate themselves,<br/>
Finding it so inclin’d.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MALCOLM.<br/>
With this there grows<br/>
In my most ill-compos’d affection such<br/>
A staunchless avarice, that, were I king,<br/>
I should cut off the nobles for their lands;<br/>
Desire his jewels, and this other’s house:<br/>
And my more-having would be as a sauce<br/>
To make me hunger more; that I should forge<br/>
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,<br/>
Destroying them for wealth.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MACDUFF.<br/>
This avarice<br/>
Sticks deeper; grows with more pernicious root<br/>
Than summer-seeming lust; and it hath been<br/>
The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;<br/>
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will,<br/>
Of your mere own. All these are portable,<br/>
With other graces weigh’d.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MALCOLM.<br/>
But I have none: the king-becoming graces,<br/>
As justice, verity, temp’rance, stableness,<br/>
Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,<br/>
Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,<br/>
I have no relish of them; but abound<br/>
In the division of each several crime,<br/>
Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should<br/>
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,<br/>
Uproar the universal peace, confound<br/>
All unity on earth.

</p>

<p class="drama">
MALCOLM.<br/>
If such a one be fit to govern, speak:<br/>
I am as I have spoken.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MACDUFF.<br/>
Fit to govern?<br/>
No, not to live.—O nation miserable,<br/>
With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter’d,<br/>
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,<br/>
Since that the truest issue of thy throne<br/>
By his own interdiction stands accus’d,<br/>
And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father<br/>
Was a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee,<br/>
Oft’ner upon her knees than on her feet,<br/>
Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!<br/>
These evils thou repeat’st upon thyself<br/>
Have banish’d me from Scotland.—O my breast,<br/>
Thy hope ends here!
</p>

<p class="drama">
MALCOLM.<br/>
Macduff, this noble passion,<br/>
Child of integrity, hath from my soul<br/>
Wiped the black scruples, reconcil’d my thoughts<br/>
To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth<br/>
By many of these trains hath sought to win me<br/>
Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me<br/>
From over-credulous haste: but God above<br/>
Deal between thee and me! for even now<br/>
I put myself to thy direction, and<br/>
Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure<br/>
The taints and blames I laid upon myself,<br/>
For strangers to my nature. I am yet<br/>
Unknown to woman; never was forsworn;<br/>
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own;<br/>
At no time broke my faith; would not betray<br/>
The devil to his fellow; and delight<br/>
No less in truth than life: my first false speaking<br/>
Was this upon myself. What I am truly,<br/>
Is thine and my poor country’s to command:<br/>
Whither, indeed, before thy here-approach,<br/>
Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,<br/>
Already at a point, was setting forth.<br/>
Now we’ll together, and the chance of goodness<br/>
Be like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?
</p>

<p class="drama">
MACDUFF.<br/>
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once<br/>
’Tis hard to reconcile.

MALCOLM.<br/>
Well; more anon.—Comes the King forth, I pray you?
</p>

<p class="drama">
DOCTOR.<br/>
Ay, sir. There are a crew of wretched souls<br/>
That stay his cure: their malady convinces<br/>
The great assay of art; but at his touch,<br/>
Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand,<br/>
They presently amend.
</p>

<p class="drama">

I thank you, doctor.

<p class="drama">
MACDUFF.<br/>
What’s the disease he means?
</p>

<p class="drama">
MALCOLM.<br/>
’Tis call’d the evil:<br/>
A most miraculous work in this good king;<br/>
Which often, since my here-remain in England,<br/>
I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,<br/>
Himself best knows, but strangely-visited people,<br/>
All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,<br/>
The mere despair of surgery, he cures;<br/>
Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,<br/>
Put on with holy prayers: and ’tis spoken,<br/>
To the succeeding royalty he leaves<br/>
The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,<br/>
He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy;<br/>
And sundry blessings hang about his throne,<br/>
That speak him full of grace.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MACDUFF.<br/>
See, who comes here?
</p>

<p class="drama">
MALCOLM.<br/>
My countryman; but yet I know him not.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MACDUFF.<br/>
My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MALCOLM.<br/>
I know him now. Good God, betimes remove<br/>
The means that makes us strangers!
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROSS.<br/>
Sir, amen.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MACDUFF.<br/>
Stands Scotland where it did?
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROSS.<br/>
Alas, poor country,<br/>
Almost afraid to know itself! It cannot<br/>
Be call’d our mother, but our grave, where nothing,<br/>
But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;<br/>
Where sighs, and groans, and shrieks, that rent the air,<br/>
Are made, not mark’d; where violent sorrow seems<br/>
A modern ecstasy. The dead man’s knell<br/>
Is there scarce ask’d for who; and good men’s lives<br/>
Expire before the flowers in their caps,<br/>
Dying or ere they sicken.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MACDUFF.<br/>
O, relation<br/>
Too nice, and yet too true!
</p>

<p class="drama">
MALCOLM.<br/>
What’s the newest grief?
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROSS.<br/>
That of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker;<br/>
Each minute teems a new one.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MACDUFF.<br/>
How does my wife?
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROSS.<br/>
Why, well.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MACDUFF.<br/>
And all my children?
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROSS.<br/>
Well too.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MACDUFF.<br/>
The tyrant has not batter’d at their peace?
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROSS.<br/>
No; they were well at peace when I did leave ’em.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MACDUFF.<br/>
Be not a niggard of your speech: how goes’t?
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROSS.<br/>
When I came hither to transport the tidings,<br/>
Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour<br/>
Of many worthy fellows that were out;<br/>
Which was to my belief witness’d the rather,<br/>
For that I saw the tyrant’s power afoot.<br/>
Now is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland<br/>
Would create soldiers, make our women fight,<br/>
To doff their dire distresses.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MALCOLM.<br/>
Be’t their comfort<br/>
We are coming thither. Gracious England hath<br/>
Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;<br/>
An older and a better soldier none<br/>
That Christendom gives out.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROSS.<br/>
Would I could answer<br/>
This comfort with the like! But I have words<br/>
That would be howl’d out in the desert air,<br/>
Where hearing should not latch them.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MACDUFF.<br/>
What concern they?<br/>
The general cause? or is it a fee-grief<br/>
Due to some single breast?
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROSS.<br/>
No mind that’s honest<br/>
But in it shares some woe, though the main part<br/>
Pertains to you alone.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MACDUFF.<br/>
If it be mine,<br/>
Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROSS.<br/>
Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,<br/>
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound<br/>
That ever yet they heard.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MACDUFF.<br/>
Humh! I guess at it.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROSS.<br/>
Your castle is surpris’d; your wife and babes<br/>
Savagely slaughter’d. To relate the manner<br/>
Were, on the quarry of these murder’d deer,<br/>
To add the death of you.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MALCOLM.<br/>
Merciful heaven!—<br/>
What, man! ne’er pull your hat upon your brows.<br/>
Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak<br/>
Whispers the o’er-fraught heart, and bids it break.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MACDUFF.<br/>
My children too?
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROSS.<br/>
Wife, children, servants, all<br/>
That could be found.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MACDUFF.<br/>
And I must be from thence!<br/>
My wife kill’d too?
</p>

<p class="drama">
ROSS.<br/>
I have said.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MALCOLM.<br/>
Be comforted:<br/>
Let’s make us med’cines of our great revenge,<br/>
To cure this deadly grief.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MACDUFF.<br/>
He has no children.—All my pretty ones?<br/>
Did you say all?—O hell-kite!—All?<br/>
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam<br/>
At one fell swoop?
</p>

<p class="drama">
MALCOLM.<br/>
Dispute it like a man.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MACDUFF.<br/>
I shall do so;<br/>
But I must also feel it as a man:<br/>
I cannot but remember such things were,<br/>
That were most precious to me.—Did heaven look on,<br/>
And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,<br/>
They were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,<br/>
Not for their own demerits, but for mine,<br/>
Fell slaughter on their souls: heaven rest them now!
</p>

<p class="drama">
MALCOLM.<br/>
Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief<br/>
Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MACDUFF.<br/>
O, I could play the woman with mine eyes,<br/>
And braggart with my tongue!—But, gentle heavens,<br/>
Cut short all intermission; front to front,<br/>
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;<br/>
Within my sword’s length set him; if he ’scape,<br/>
Heaven forgive him too!
</p>

<p class="drama">
MALCOLM.<br/>
This tune goes manly.<br/>
Come, go we to the King. Our power is ready;<br/>
Our lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth<br/>
Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above<br/>
Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may;<br/>
The night is long that never finds the day.

<h3><b>SCENE I. Dunsinane. A Room in the Castle.</b></h3>

<p class="scenedesc">Enter a <span class="charname">Doctor of Physic</span> and a
<span class="charname">Waiting-Gentlewoman</span>.</p>

<p class="drama">
DOCTOR.<br/>
I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no truth in your report.
When was it she last walked?
</p>

<p class="drama">
GENTLEWOMAN.<br/>
Since his Majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw
her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write
upon’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all
this while in a most fast sleep.
</p>

<p class="drama">
DOCTOR.<br/>
A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep, and do
the effects of watching. In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and
other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say?
</p>

<p class="drama">
GENTLEWOMAN.<br/>
That, sir, which I will not report after her.
</p>

<p class="drama">
DOCTOR.<br/>
You may to me; and ’tis most meet you should.
</p>

<p class="drama">
GENTLEWOMAN.<br/>
Neither to you nor anyone; having no witness to confirm my speech.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Lady Macbeth</span> with a taper.</p>

<p class="drama">
Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast
asleep. Observe her; stand close.
</p>

<p class="drama">
DOCTOR.<br/>
How came she by that light?
</p>

<p class="drama">
GENTLEWOMAN.<br/>
Why, it stood by her: she has light by her continually; ’tis her command.
</p>

<p class="drama">
DOCTOR.<br/>
You see, her eyes are open.
</p>

<p class="drama">
GENTLEWOMAN.<br/>
Ay, but their sense are shut.
</p>

<p class="drama">
DOCTOR.<br/>
What is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands.
</p>

<p class="drama">
GENTLEWOMAN.<br/>
It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands. I have
known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY MACBETH.<br/>
Yet here’s a spot.
</p>

<p class="drama">
DOCTOR.<br/>
Hark, she speaks. I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my
remembrance the more strongly.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY MACBETH.<br/>
Out, damned spot! out, I say! One; two. Why, then ’tis time to
do’t. Hell is murky! Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need
we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account? Yet who would
have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?
</p>

<p class="drama">
DOCTOR.<br/>
Do you mark that?
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY MACBETH.<br/>
The Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now?—What, will these hands
ne’er be clean? No more o’ that, my lord, no more o’ that:
you mar all with this starting.
</p>

<p class="drama">
DOCTOR.<br/>
Go to, go to. You have known what you should not.
</p>

<p class="drama">
GENTLEWOMAN.<br/>
She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that: heaven knows what she has
known.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY MACBETH.<br/>
Here’s the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will not
sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!
</p>

<p class="drama">
DOCTOR.<br/>
What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.
</p>

<p class="drama">
GENTLEWOMAN.<br/>
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body.
</p>

<p class="drama">
DOCTOR.<br/>
Well, well, well.
</p>

<p class="drama">
GENTLEWOMAN.<br/>
Pray God it be, sir.
</p>

<p class="drama">
DOCTOR.<br/>
This disease is beyond my practice: yet I have known those which have walked in
their sleep, who have died holily in their beds.
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY MACBETH.<br/>
Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so pale. I tell you yet again,
Banquo’s buried; he cannot come out on’s grave.
</p>

<p class="drama">
DOCTOR.<br/>
Even so?
</p>

<p class="drama">
LADY MACBETH.<br/>
To bed, to bed. There’s knocking at the gate. Come, come, come, come,
give me your hand. What’s done cannot be undone. To bed, to bed, to bed.
</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p class="drama">
DOCTOR.<br/>
Will she go now to bed?
</p>

<p class="drama">
GENTLEWOMAN.<br/>
Directly.
</p>

<p class="drama">
DOCTOR.<br/>
Foul whisp’rings are abroad. Unnatural deeds<br/>
Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds<br/>
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.<br/>
More needs she the divine than the physician.—<br/>
God, God, forgive us all! Look after her;<br/>
Remove from her the means of all annoyance,<br/>
And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:<br/>
My mind she has mated, and amaz’d my sight.<br/>
I think, but dare not speak.

MENTEITH.<br/>
What does the tyrant?
</p>

<p class="drama">
CAITHNESS.<br/>
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.<br/>
Some say he’s mad; others, that lesser hate him,<br/>
Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,<br/>
He cannot buckle his distemper’d cause<br/>
Within the belt of rule.
</p>

<p class="drama">
ANGUS.<br/>
Now does he feel<br/>
His secret murders sticking on his hands;<br/>
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;<br/>
Those he commands move only in command,<br/>
Nothing in love: now does he feel his title<br/>
Hang loose about him, like a giant’s robe<br/>
Upon a dwarfish thief.
</p>

<p class="drama">
MENTEITH.<br/>
Who, then, shall blame<br/>
His pester’d senses to recoil and start,<br/>

Itself for being there?

Well, march we on,<br/>

Each drop of us.

MACBETH.<br/>
Hang out our banners on the outward walls;<br/>
The cry is still, “They come!” Our castle’s strength<br/>
Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie<br/>
Till famine and the ague eat them up.<br/>
Were they not forc’d with those that should be ours,<br/>
We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,<br/>
And beat them backward home.

I have almost forgot the taste of fears.<br/>
The time has been, my senses would have cool’d<br/>
To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair<br/>
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir<br/>
As life were in’t. I have supp’d full with horrors;<br/>
Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,<br/>
Cannot once start me.

She should have died hereafter.<br/>
There would have been a time for such a word.<br/>
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,<br/>
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,<br/>
To the last syllable of recorded time;<br/>
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools<br/>
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!<br/>
Life’s but a walking shadow; a poor player,<br/>
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,<br/>
And then is heard no more: it is a tale<br/>
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br/>
Signifying nothing.

Thou com’st to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.

Gracious my lord,<br/>
I should report that which I say I saw,<br/>

MACBETH.<br/>
Well, say, sir.

As I did stand my watch upon the hill,<br/>
I look’d toward Birnam, and anon, methought,<br/>
The wood began to move.

Liar, and slave!

Let me endure your wrath, if’t be not so.<br/>

MACBETH.<br/>
If thou speak’st false,<br/>
Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,<br/>
Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,<br/>
I care not if thou dost for me as much.—<br/>
I pull in resolution; and begin<br/>
To doubt th’ equivocation of the fiend,<br/>
That lies like truth. “Fear not, till Birnam wood<br/>
Do come to Dunsinane;” and now a wood<br/>
Comes toward Dunsinane.—Arm, arm, and out!—<br/>
If this which he avouches does appear,<br/>
There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.<br/>
I ’gin to be aweary of the sun,<br/>
And wish th’ estate o’ th’ world were now undone.—<br/>
Ring the alarum bell!—Blow, wind! come, wrack!<br/>
At least we’ll die with harness on our back.
