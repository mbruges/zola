## What's in a name?

> "But Mouse, you are not alone,
In proving foresight may be vain:
The best laid plans **of mice and men**
Often go awry,
And leave us nothing but grief and pain,
For promised joy"

> "A few miles south of Soledad, the Salinas River drops in close to the hillside bank and runs deep and green. The water is warm too, for it has slipped twinkling over the yellow sands in the sunlight before reaching the narrow pool. On one side of the river the golden foothill slopes curve up to the strong and rocky Gabilan Mountains, but on the valley side the water is lined with trees‚Äî willows fresh and green with every spring, carrying in their lower leaf junctures the debris of the winter‚Äôs flooding; and sycamores with mottled, white, recumbent limbs and branches that arch over the pool. On the sandy bank under the trees the leaves lie deep and so crisp that a lizard makes a great skittering if he runs among them. Rabbits come out of the brush to sit on the sand in the evening, and the damp flats are covered with the night tracks of ‚Äòcoons, and with the spreadpads of dogs from the ranches, and with the split-wedge tracks of deer that come to drink in the dark. 
> There is a path through the willows and among the sycamores, a path beaten hard by boys coming down from the ranches to swim in the deep pool, and beaten hard by tramps who come wearily down from the highway in the evening to jungle-up near water. In front of the low horizontal limb of a giant sycamore there is an ash pile made by many fires; the limb is worn smooth by men who have sat on it."

## A model paragraph


>  In the opening of the novel, Steinbeck presents the nature of California as an Edenic paradise. He achieves this by beginning the narrative not with descriptions of the human characters, but rather with the beautiful and undisturbed natural world of the Salinas Valley. Readers in 1937 would have thought of California as a place of untouched natural beauty and fertile soil, in contrast to the industrialised, urban East Coast, and the Dustbowl-ravaged Midwest. However, the arrival of George and Lennie causes the scene to become "lifeless". This could reflect the natural cost and damage caused by the American Dream of endless progress. In this moment, Steinbeck encapsulates the story of American colonisation of the continent: men arrives and drive away nature.

</columns>

> The bunk house was a long, rectangular building. Inside, the walls were whitewashed and the floor unpainted. In three walls there were small, square windows, and in the fourth, a solid door with a wooden latch. Against the walls were eight bunks, five of them made up with blankets and the other three showing their burlap ticking. Over each bunk there was nailed an apple box with the opening forward so that it made two shelves for the personal belongings of the occupant of the bunk. And these shelves were loaded with little articles, soap and talcum powder, razors and those Western magazines ranch men love to read and scoff at and secretly believe. And there were medicines on the shelves, and little vials, combs; and from nails on the box sides, a few neckties. Near one wall there was a black cast-iron stove, its stovepipe going straight up through the ceiling. In the middle of the room stood a big square table littered with playing cards, and around it were grouped boxes for the players to sit on.

## Enter Candy

> [](task) Why isn't Candy given a name here?

> The door opened and a tall, stoop-shouldered old man came in. He was dressed in blue jeans and he carried a big push-broom in his left hand. Behind him came George, and behind George, Lennie.
> ‚ÄúThe boss was expectin‚Äô you last night,‚Äù the old man said. ‚ÄúHe was sore as hell when you wasn‚Äôt here to go out this morning.‚Äù He pointed with his right arm, and out of the sleeve came a round stick-like wrist, but no hand. ‚ÄúYou can have them two beds there,‚Äù he said, indicating two bunks near the stove.
> George stepped over and threw his blankets down on the burlap sack of straw that was a mattress. He looked into his box shelf and then picked a small yellow can from it. ‚ÄúSay. What the hell‚Äôs this?‚Äù   ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù said the old man.

## Looking at Slim

> A tall man stood in the doorway. He held a crushed Stetson hat under his arm while he combed his long, black, damp hair straight back. Like the others he wore blue jeans and a short denim jacket. When he had finished combing his hair he moved into the room, and he moved with a majesty only achieved by royalty and master craftsmen. He was a jerkline skinner, the prince of the ranch, capable of driving ten, sixteen, even twenty mules with a single line to the leaders. He was capable of killing a fly on the wheeler‚Äôs butt with a bull whip without touching the mule. There was a gravity in his manner and a quiet so profound that all talk stopped when he spoke. His authority was so great that his word was taken on any subject, be it politics or love. This was Slim, the jerkline skinner. His hatchet face was ageless. He might have been thirty-five or fifty. His ear heard more than was said to him, and his slow speech had overtones not of thought, but of understanding beyond thought. His hands, large and lean, were as delicate in their action as those of a temple dancer.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs funny about it?‚Äù George demanded defensively.
‚ÄúOh, I dunno. Hardly none of the guys ever travel together. I hardly never seen two guys travel together. You know how the hands are, they just come in and get their bunk and work a month, and then they quit and go out alone. Never seem to give a damn about nobody. It jus‚Äô seems kinda funny a cuckoo like him and a smart little guy like you travelin‚Äô together.‚Äù

## "He ain't no good"

> Carson stopped and sniffed the air, and still sniffing, looked down at the old dog. ‚ÄúGod awmighty, that dog stinks. Get him outa here, Candy! I don‚Äôt know nothing that stinks as bad as an old dog. You gotta get him out.‚Äù  
Candy rolled to the edge of his bunk. He reached over and patted the ancient dog, and he apologized, ‚ÄúI been around him so much I never notice how he stinks.‚Äù  
‚ÄúWell, I can‚Äôt stand him in here,‚Äù said Carlson. ‚ÄúThat stink hangs around even after he‚Äôs gone.‚Äù He walked over with his heavy-legged stride and looked down at the dog. ‚ÄúGot no teeth,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs all stiff with rheumatism. **He ain‚Äôt no good to you, Candy. An‚Äô he ain‚Äôt no good to himself. Why‚Äôn‚Äôt you shoot him, Candy?‚Äù**
The old man squirmed uncomfortably. ‚ÄúWell‚Äîhell! I had him so long. Had him since he was a pup. I herded sheep with him.‚Äù He said proudly, ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt think it to look at him now, but he was the best damn sheep dog I ever seen.‚Äù

# "He wouldn't feel nothing"

LO: To consider how Steinbeck presents the competing dreams of the men

>[](task) Summarise what you think Steinbeck wants us to understand about American culture, through Candy and his dog.

>[](challenge) Does Steinbeck agree with this view of the world? How do you know?

>Carlson said, ‚ÄúThe way I‚Äôd shoot him, he wouldn‚Äôt feel nothing. I‚Äôd put the gun right there.‚Äù He pointed with his toe. ‚ÄúRight back of the head. He wouldn‚Äôt even quiver.‚Äù  
Candy looked for help from face to face. It was quite dark outside by now. 
>> [Chapter 3](https://mxb.fyi/textbook/of-mice-and-men-text#p421)

---

> During the conversation Carlson had refused to be drawn in. He continued to look down at the old dog. Candy watched him uneasily. At last Carlson said, ‚ÄúIf you want me to, I‚Äôll put the old devil out of his misery right now and get it over with. Ain‚Äôt nothing left for him. Can‚Äôt eat, can‚Äôt see, can‚Äôt even walk without hurtin‚Äô.‚Äù  
Candy said hopefully, ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt got no gun.‚Äù  
‚ÄúThe hell I ain‚Äôt. Got a Luger. It won‚Äôt hurt him none at all.‚Äù  
Candy said, ‚ÄúMaybe tomorra. Le‚Äôs wait till tomorra.‚Äù  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see no reason for it,‚Äù said Carlson. He went to his bunk, pulled his bag from underneath it and took out a Luger pistol. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get it over with,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt sleep with him stinkin‚Äô around in here.‚Äù He put the pistol in his hip pocket.  Candy looked a long time at Slim to try to find some reversal. And Slim gave him none. At last Candy said softly and hopelessly, ‚ÄúAwright‚Äîtake ‚Äôim.‚Äù He did not look down at the dog at all. He lay back on his bunk and crossed his arms behind his head and stared at the ceiling.  
>> [Chapter 3](https://mxb.fyi/textbook/of-mice-and-men-text#p437)

> From his pocket Carlson took a little leather thong. He stooped over and tied it around the old dog‚Äôs neck. All the men except Candy watched him. ‚ÄúCome boy. Come on, boy,‚Äù he said gently. And he said apologetically to Candy, ‚ÄúHe won‚Äôt even feel it.‚Äù Candy did not move nor answer him. He twitched the thong. ‚ÄúCome on, boy.‚Äù The old dog got slowly and stiffly to his feet and followed the gently pulling leash.  
Slim said, ‚ÄúCarlson. You know what to do.‚Äù  
‚ÄúWhat ya mean, Slim?‚Äù  
‚ÄúTake a shovel,‚Äù said Slim shortly.  
‚ÄúOh, sure! I get you.‚Äù He led the dog out into the darkness [...]
George brought the cards together tightly and studied the backs of them. The silence was in the room again.  
A shot sounded in the distance. The men looked quickly at the old man. Every head turned toward him.  
For a moment he continued to stare at the ceiling. Then he rolled slowly over and faced the wall and lay silent.

## Describing Crooks

>[](task) What do we learn about Crooks from this description? Write a bulleted list

> Crooks, the negro stable buck, had his bunk in the harness room; a little shed that leaned off the wall of the barn. On one side of the little room there was a square four-paned window, and on the other, a narrow plank door leading into the barn. Crooks‚Äô bunk was a long box filled with straw, on which his blankets were flung. On the wall by the window there were pegs on which hung broken harness in process of being mended; strips of new leather; and under the window itself a little bench for leather-working tools, curved knives and needles and balls of linen thread, and a small hand riveter. On pegs were also pieces of harness, a split collar with the horsehair stuffing sticking out, a broken hame, and a trace chain with its leather covering split. Crooks had his apple box over his bunk, and in it a range of medicine bottles, both for himself and for the horses. There were cans of saddle soap and a drippy can of tar with its paint brush sticking over the edge. And scattered about the floor were a number of personal possessions; for, being alone, Crooks could leave his things about, and being a stable buck and a cripple, he was more permanent than the other men, and he had accumulated more possessions than he could carry on his back.

---

> Crooks possessed several pairs of shoes, a pair of rubber boots, a big alarm clock and a single-barreled shotgun. And he had books, too; a tattered dictionary and a mauled copy of the California civil code for 1905. There were battered magazines and a few dirty books on a special shelf over his bunk. A pair of large gold-rimmed spectacles hung from a nail on the wall above his bed.  
This room was swept and fairly neat, for Crooks was a proud, aloof man. He kept his distance and demanded that other people keep theirs. His body was bent over to the left by his crooked spine, and his eyes lay deep in his head, and because of their depth seemed to glitter with intensity. His lean face was lined with deep black wrinkles, and he had thin, pain-tightened lips which were lighter than his face.

## Back to the Ending

> The deep green pool of the Salinas River was still in the late afternoon. Already the sun had left the valley to go climbing up the slopes of the Gabilan mountains, and the hilltops were rosy in the sun. But by the pool among the mottled sycamores, a pleasant shade had fallen.  
A water snake glided smoothly up the pool, twisting its periscope head from side to side; and it swam the length of the pool and came to the legs of a motionless heron that stood in the shallows. A silent head and beak lanced down and plucked it out by the head, and the beak swallowed the little snake while its tail waved frantically.

>[](task) Note down three things relevant for the **Nature** question

>[](challenge) How is this scene different from the opening of the novel?

> Lennie said, ‚ÄúI thought you was mad at me, George.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said George. ‚ÄúNo, Lennie. I ain‚Äôt mad. I never been mad, an‚Äô I ain‚Äôt now. That‚Äôs a thing I want ya to know.‚Äù  
The voices came close now. George raised the gun and listened to the voices,  
Lennie begged, ‚ÄúLe‚Äôs do it now. Let‚Äôs get that place now.‚Äù  
‚ÄúSure, right now. I gotta. We gotta.‚Äù  
And George raised the gun and steadied it, and he brought the muzzle of it close to the back of Lennie‚Äôs head. The hand shook violently, but his face set and his hand steadied. He pulled the trigger. The crash of the shot rolled up the hills and rolled down again. Lennie jarred, and then settled slowly forward to the sand, and he lay without quivering.  
George shivered and looked at the gun, and then he threw it from him, back up on the bank, near the pile of old ashes.

- `C`**ontext** - *what historical/social/authorial context is relevant?*
- `K`**nowledge** - *what other bits of the novel could this link with?*

</div>

At the end of the novel, Steinbeck uses nature to emphasise the loneliness of the characters. He opens the chapter describing a scene without humans, and later the echoing sound of the gunshot. These natural descriptions emphasise the emptiness of the world around George  now that Lennie is gone. Steinbeck could be suggesting that the natural state for itinerant workers like Lennie and George is one of loneliness and separation, like the individual animals described in this scene and the opening. Steinbeck portrays an America in the 1930s that is a place where people must live and work alone, looking after only themselves.

>[](task) Finish this sentence:
> _In the novel, Steinbeck wants us to understand that isolation in 1930s America is caused by..._

>[](challenge) Which characters APART from Candy and Crooks could you have written about?

---

## Whole-class improvements

### 1. Start with an argument üó£Ô∏è

- **AO1** is all about your personal interpretation
- Take a stance!
- Phrases like "I would argue...", "It could be argued that..." will help

| Level 2 üëé | Level 5 üëç |
| :---: | :---: |
| "In the novel, there are lots of isolated characters. These include..." | "I would argue that characters are isolated by their identity, not their actions." |
| *Vague, listing things rather than criticising* | *Clear argument to follow, personal* |

---

## Whole-class improvements

### 2. Keep context SPECIFIC and LINKED to your argument ‚õìÔ∏è

- **AO4** is not about remembering facts, it's about linking them to your argument
- Always ask: is this context *relevant* to what I'm saying?
- Avoid sweeping generalisations
- Phrases like "Steinbeck references...", "A reader at the time would have thought of..." will help


| Level 2 üëé | Level 5 üëç |
| :---: | :---: |
| "Crooks is separated from the other workers. Everyone in America then was racist." | "The 'Civil Code' on the shelf would immediately suggest to a reader of the time that Crooks has to work hard to defend his rights in the racist society of 1930s America" |
| *Not specific, generalised, not linked to argument* | *Specific reference, linked to character and text* |

---

## Whole-class improvements

### 3. Refer to the WHOLE novel üìñ

- **AO1** requires you to show your knowledge
- If you only reference three moments, the examiner can't reward you fully
- References can be broad and brief - just show how they link to the Question

| Level 2 üëé | Level 5 üëç |
| :---: | :---: |
| "Candy's dog is taken away and shot, this shows he's isolated." | "From Candy's first entrance, to the moment his dog is taken from him, to his final scene with the body of Curley's wife, he is always presented as isolated and weak." |
| *Only looking at one specific moment* | *Finding commonality across the novel* |
