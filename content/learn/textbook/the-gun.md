Bringing a gun into a house  
changes it.  
  
You lay it on the kitchen table,  
stretched out like something dead  
itself: the grainy polished wood stock  
jutting over the edge,  
the long metal barrel  
casting a grey shadow  
on the green-checked cloth.  
  
At first itâ€™s just practice:  
perforating tins  
dangling on orange string  
from trees in the garden.  
Then a rabbit shot  
clean through the head.  
  
Soon the fridge fills with creatures  
that have run and flown.  
Your hands reek of gun oil.  
And entrails. You trample  
fur and feathers. Thereâ€™s a spring  
in your step; your eyes gleam  
like when sex was fresh.  
A gun brings a house alive.  
I join in the cooking: jointing  
and slicing, stirring and tasting â€“  
excited as if the King of Death  
had arrived to feast, stalking  
out of winters woods,  
his black mouth  
sprouting golden crocuses.
