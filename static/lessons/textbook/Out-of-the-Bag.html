<h2 id="i">I</h2>
<p>All of us came in Doctor Kerlin's bag.<br>
He'd arrive with it, disappear to the room<br>
And by the time he'd reappear to wash</p>
<p>Those nosy, rosy, big, soft hands of his<br>
In the scullery basin, its lined insides<br>
(The colour of a spaniel's inside lug)</p>
<p>Were empty for all to see, the trap-sprung mouth<br>
Unsnibbed and gaping wide. Then like a hypnotist<br>
Unwinding us, he'd wind the instruments</p>
<p>Back into their lining, tie the cloth<br>
Like an apron round itself,<br>
Darken the door and leave</p>
<p>With the bag in his hand, a plump ark by the keel ...<br>
Until the next time came and in he'd come<br>
In his fur-lined collar that was also spaniel-coloured</p>
<p>And go stooping up to the room again, a whiff<br>
Of disinfectant, a Dutch interior gleam<br>
Of waistcoat satin and highlights on the forceps.</p>
<p>Getting the water ready, that was next‚Äî<br>
Not plumping hot, and not lukewarm, but soft,<br>
Sud-luscious, saved for him from the rain-butt<br>
And savoured by him afterwards, all thanks<br>
Denied as he towelled hard and fast,<br>
Then held his arms out suddenly behind him</p>
<p>To be squired and silk-lined into the camel coat.<br>
At which point he once turned his eyes upon me,<br>
Hyperborean, beyond-the-north-wind blue,</p>
<p>Two peepholes to the locked room I saw into<br>
Every time his name was mentioned, skimmed<br>
Milk and ice, swabbed porcelain, the white</p>
<p>And chill of tiles, steel hooks, chrome surgery tools<br>
And blood dreeps in the sawdust where it thickened<br>
At the foot of each cold wall. And overhead</p>
<p>The little, pendent, teat-hued infant parts<br>
Strung neatly from a line up near the ceiling‚Äî<br>
A toe, a foot and shin, an arm, a cock</p>
<p>A bit like the rosebud in his buttonhole.</p>
<h2 id="ii">II</h2>
<p>Poeta doctus Peter Levi says<br>
Sanctuaries of Asclepius (called asclepions)<br>
Were the equivalent of hospitals</p>
<p>In ancient Greece. Or of shrines like Lourdes,<br>
Says poeta doctus Graves. Or of the cure<br>
By poetry that cannot be coerced,</p>
<p>Say I, who realized at Epidaurus<br>
That the whole place was a sanatorium<br>
With theatre and gymnasium and baths,</p>
<p>A site of incubation, where &quot;incubation&quot;<br>
Was technical and ritual, meaning sleep<br>
When epiphany occurred and you met the god ...</p>
<p>Hatless, groggy, shadowing myself<br>
As the thurifer I was in an open air procession<br>
In Lourdes in '56</p>
<p>When I nearly fainted from the heat and fumes,<br>
Again I nearly fainted as I bent<br>
To pull a bunch of grass and hallucinated</p>
<p>Doctor Kerlin at the steamed-up glass<br>
Of our scullery window, starting in to draw<br>
With his large pink index finger dot-faced men<br>
With button-spots in a straight line down their fronts<br>
And women with dot breasts, giving them all<br>
A set of droopy sausage-arms and legs</p>
<p>That soon began to run. And then as he dipped and laved<br>
In the generous suds again, miraculum:<br>
The baby bits all came together swimming</p>
<p>Into his soapy big hygienic hands<br>
And I myself came to, blinded with sweat,<br>
Blinking and shaky in the windless light.</p>
<h2 id="iii">III</h2>
<p>Bits of the grass I pulled I posted off<br>
To one going into chemotherapy<br>
And one who had come through. I didn't want</p>
<p>To leave the place or link up with the others.<br>
It was mid-day, mid-May, pre-tourist sunlight<br>
In the precincts of the god,</p>
<p>The very site of the temple of Asclepius.<br>
I wanted nothing more than to lie down<br>
Under hogweed, under seeded grass</p>
<p>And to be visited in the very eye of the day<br>
By Hygeia, his daughter, her name still clarifying<br>
The haven of light she was, the undarkening door.</p>
<h2 id="iv">IV</h2>
<p>The room I came from and the rest of us all came from<br>
Stays pure reality where I stand alone,<br>
Standing the passage of time, and she's asleep</p>
<p>In sheets put on for the doctor, wedding presents<br>
That showed up again and again, bridal<br>
And usual and useful at births and deaths.</p>
<p>Me at the bedside, incubating for real,<br>
Peering, appearing to her as she closes<br>
And opens her eyes, then lapses back</p>
<p>Into a faraway smile whose precinct of vision<br>
I would enter every time, to assist and be asked<br>
In that hoarsened whisper of triumph,</p>
<p>&quot;And what do you think<br>
Of the new wee baby the doctor brought for us all<br>
When I was asleep?&quot;</p>
