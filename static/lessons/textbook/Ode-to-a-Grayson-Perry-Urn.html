<p>Hello! What's all this here? A kitschy vase<br>
some Shirley Temple manqu√© has knocked out<br>
delineating tales of kids in cars<br>
on crap estates, the Burberry clad louts<br>
who flail their motors through the smoky night<br>
from Manchester to Motherwell or Slough,<br>
creating bedlam on the Queen's highway.<br>
Your gaudy evocation can, somehow,<br>
conjure the scene without inducing fright,<br>
as would a Daily Express expos√©,</p>
<p>can bring to mind the throaty turbo roar<br>
of hatchbacks tuned almost to breaking point,<br>
the joyful throb of UK garage or<br>
of house imported from the continent<br>
and yet educe a sense of peace, of calm -<br>
the screech of tyres and the nervous squeals<br>
of girls, too young to quite appreciate<br>
the peril they are in, are heard, but these wheels<br>
will not lose traction, skid and flip, no harm<br>
befall these children. They will stay out late</p>
<p>forever, pumped on youth and ecstasy,<br>
on alloy, bass and arrogance, and speed<br>
the back lanes, the urban gyratory,<br>
the wide motorways, never having need<br>
to race back home, for work next day, to bed.<br>
Each girl is buff, each geezer toned and strong,<br>
charged with pulsing juice which, even yet,<br>
fills every pair of Calvin‚Äôs and each thong,<br>
never to be deflated, given head<br>
in crude games of chlamydia roulette.<br>
Now see who comes to line the sparse grass verge,<br>
to toast them in Buckfast and Diamond White:<br>
rat-boys and corn-rowed cheerleaders who urge<br>
them on to pull more burn-outs or to write<br>
their donut Os, as signature, upon<br>
the bleached tarmac of dead suburban streets.<br>
There dogs set up a row and curtains twitch<br>
as pensioners and parents telephone<br>
the cops to plead for quiet, sue for peace -<br>
tranquility, though, is for the rich.</p>
<p>And so, millennia hence, you garish crock,<br>
when all context is lost, galleries razed<br>
to level dust and we're long in the box,<br>
will future poets look on you amazed,<br>
speculate how children might have lived when<br>
you were fired, lives so free and bountiful<br>
and there, beneath a sun a little colder,<br>
declare <em>How happy were those creatures then,</em><br>
<em>who knew the truth was all negotiable</em><br>
<em>and beauty in the gift of the beholder.</em></p>
<p><em>by Tim Turnbull</em></p>
