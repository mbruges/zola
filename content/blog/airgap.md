Fortinet et al were great when all one wanted to do was stop Year accidentally receiving a *very* detailed biology lesson. But what do you do when the world's defacto homepage becomes an engine for undetectable plagiarism? Or when the blue links on the results page lead only to error-strewn, AI-generated slop?

Here's one solution: you make your own Internet.

## A whitelist of one

Our use case is simple: we want an Internet that our students can use to research information and gather ideas. We want that information to be reliable and - crucially - easily detectable if our darling charges simply copy and paste.

Frankly, there's only one site they need: Wikipedia (to be generous, we'll chuck in some of the other Wikimedia elements too).
