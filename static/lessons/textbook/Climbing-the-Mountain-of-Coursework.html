<blockquote>
<p><a href="note"></a> Coursework is all but eliminated in the UK system, though is still quite common in the international variants of GCSE and A-Level. That's the perspective I'll be looking at here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a teacher's perspective, it's lose-lose: help too much, and you suck up a term's worth of time and yield results divergent from what the students 'deserve'. Help too little, and you're opened up to criticism from parents and SLT.</p>
<p>The appeal of simply leaving it all to the exam board, placing fate in the lap of the gods, is strong. But there are still advantages to the coursework approach, if managed properly.</p>
<h2 id="be-explorative-not-prescriptive">Be explorative, not prescriptive</h2>
<p>The best coursework is that which flows from a student's own ideas. Every Sixth Form teacher has a story of a reluctant learner, suddenly struck with inspiration when allowed onto the green-field of an EPQ. Given the freedom to choose a topic and path is liberating, even for reluctant learners. But preparing them for this free-form approach is a different matter.</p>
<aside> 
<blockquote>
<p><a href="tip"></a> Digital or paper, it doesn't matter, but keep it to one side of A4-equivalent if you can (for your sanity in checking and their reluctance in writing).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>'Permissive planning' is a quick way to bring students on board. Rather than dumping them into a blank <code>.docx</code> file, provide a highly-structured planning document for them to complete first. Think &quot;doctor's surgery registration form&quot; rather than &quot;mind-map&quot;: clearly laid out boxes and lines with leading questions, each requiring no more than a sentence or two.</p>
<p>Keeping planning this prescriptive ensures students focus their thinking on the parts that matter, whilst you implicitly indicate the criteria and think that matter in the given coursework.</p>
<p>Framing the document as a 'permit' also helps this: students might already have an idea or theme they're keen on, and this document can help to focus their thoughts into an academically-acceptable framework.</p>
