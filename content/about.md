![A picture of me, Max Bruges aside](/headshot.webp)
*It's me, Max Bruges*

...though unless you're *very* tenacious with your Googling, we've probably met already[^1].

**I'm Max Bruges: an education specialist with a technology background, and a passion for using tech to transform the way we teach and learn.**

I have been Head of English for a few years now, long enough to know that we can always be doing more to experiment and improve. Hopefully, what you find here will help you to do just that.

I first built this website largely as a place to practice my coding and to learn new skills (the details of which I will bore you with [here on the blog](/blog)).  What started as some shoddily handcrafted HTML has now grown into something a bit more substantial.

Poke around!
- 🧪 Try some [experiments](/experiments), from [games](@/experiments/hangman.md) to [AI-powered writing tools](@/experiments/kickstart.md) and a [virtual librarian](../experiments/ai-librarian.html).
- 👨‍🏫 Flick through some of my past [lessons](/learn) and [worksheets](/learn/textbook/)
- 🔴 You can even join a [live lesson](https://learn.maxbruges.com/), if I'm teaching right now!

**If you'd like to chat, you can [drop me an email 📬](mailto:hello@maxbruges.com) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/max-bruges).**

[^1]: I may also look vaguely familiar if you're a connoisseur of mid-afternoon television quiz shows and/or Egyptian historical dramas
