<p><strong>William Blake</strong> was a famous poet and artist born on 28 November 1757, in London, England. He grew up in a middle-class family, the third of seven children. His father, James Blake, was a clothes-maker, and Blake was educated at home by his mother rather than attending school. The family was religious, belonging to the Moravian Church, and the Bible had a significant impact on Blake's life, influencing his thoughts and writings throughout his career.</p>
<p>Blake showed artistic talent from a young age. He began engraving images of Greek antiquities<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, which his father had bought for him. This early exposure to classical art inspired him throughout his life. His parents recognised his strong will and enrolled him in drawing classes instead of sending him to school. Blake was an avid reader, exploring poetry on his own and drawing inspiration from writers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Jonson">Ben Jonson</a> and Edmund Spenser.</p>
<p>At the age of 14, Blake became an apprentice to the engraver James Basire, a position he held for seven years. During his apprenticeship, he explored Gothic architecture, sketching in Westminster Abbey where he encountered vivid visions and inspirations that would shape his artistic style. After finishing his apprenticeship, Blake studied at the Royal Academy, where he clashed with the prevailing artistic norms of the time. He rejected the idea of general beauty championed by the Academy's president, Joshua Reynolds, arguing instead for the importance of individual expression in art.</p>
<p>In 1780, Blake found himself swept up in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Riots">Gordon Riots</a>, a protest against the treatment of Catholics in England. Although some claim he was forced into the mob, Blake's involvement highlighted his rebellious spirit. A few years later, in 1782, he married Catherine Boucher, who would be his devoted partner for life. Catherine was illiterate at the time, but Blake taught her to read and write, and she became an essential collaborator in his artistic projects.</p>
<p>Blake published his first collection of poems, &quot;Poetical Sketches,&quot; around 1783. He also experimented with a unique printing method called relief etching, which allowed him to combine text and illustrations in a way that resembled illuminated manuscripts. This technique became the foundation for many of his most famous works, including &quot;Songs of Innocence and Experience,&quot; where he explored themes of childhood, innocence, and experience through poetry and art.</p>

<p>As he continued to develop his style, Blake's work often reflected his political and social beliefs. He was influenced by the revolutionary ideals of the American and French revolutions, advocating for personal freedom and social justice. His poetry, such as &quot;Visions of the Daughters of Albion,&quot; challenged societal norms, particularly regarding women's rights and the institution of marriage.</p>
<p>In 1800, Blake moved to a cottage in Felpham, Sussex, where he worked on illustrating the works of other poets, including William Hayley. However, he grew frustrated with Hayley's commercial focus and began to feel trapped by the constraints of his patronage<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. During this time, he also faced legal troubles after a confrontation with a soldier led to accusations of treason, although he was ultimately cleared.</p>
<p>Blake returned to London in 1804 and began working on his most ambitious project, &quot;Jerusalem,&quot; a poetic work filled with his visionary ideas. He continued to create illustrations and engravings, gaining recognition for his unique style, although he often struggled with financial instability. His later works included illustrations for &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)">Dante's Inferno</a>,&quot; which demonstrated his mastery of watercolour and his ability to convey complex themes.</p>
<p>Blake's life came to an end on 12 August 1827. On his deathbed, he expressed his love for Catherine, drawing her portrait with his final moments. After his death, Catherine continued to promote his work, believing she felt his spirit guiding her. Although many of Blake's manuscripts were lost or destroyed after his death, his legacy endured. Today, he is celebrated as a significant figure in literature and art, with memorials and prizes established in his honour. Blake's unique vision and creativity continue to inspire readers and artists around the world.</p>
