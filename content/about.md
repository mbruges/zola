![A picture of me, Max Bruges aside](/headshot.webp)
*It's me, Max Bruges*

...though unless you're *very* tenacious with your Googling, we've probably met already[^1].

**I'm an education specialist, with a passion for using technology to transform the way we teach and learn.**


I have been Head of English for a few years now, long enough to know that we can always be doing more to experiment and improve. Hopefully, what you find here will help you to do just that.

I built this website largely as a place to practice my coding and to learn new skills (the details of which I will bore you with [here on the blog](/blog)).  What started as some shoddily handcrafted HTML is now a slightly slicker static-site. Poke around: try some of the [experiments here](/experiments) and flick through some of my [lessons here](/learn).

**If you'd like to chat, you can [drop me an email 📬](mailto:hello@maxbruges.com) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/max-bruges).**

[^1]: I may also look vaguely familiar if you're a connoisseur of mid-afternoon television quiz shows and/or Egyptian historical dramas
