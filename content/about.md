![A picture of me, Max Bruges aside](/headshot.webp)

...though unless you're *very* tenacious with your Googling, we've probably met already [^1]

I built this website largely as a place to practice my coding and to learn new skills (the details of which I will bore you with [here](/blog)).  What started as some shoddily handcrafted HTML is now a slightly slicker static-site. So poke around and try some of the [experiments](https://maxbruges.com/experiments.html). Feel free to download and use the [resources](https://maxbruges.com/resources.html), too.

I have been Head of English for a few years now, long enough to know that we can always be doing more to experiment and improve. Hopefully, what you find here will help you to do just that.

If you'd like to chat, you can [drop me an email 📬](mailto:hello@maxbruges.com)

[^1]: I may also look vaguely familiar if you're a connoisseur of mid-afternoon television quiz shows and/or Egyptian historical dramas
