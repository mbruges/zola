<p><em>St Andrews: West Sands; September 2001</em><br>
Today as we flew the kites -<br>
the sand spinning off in ribbons along the beach<br>
and that gasoline smell from Leuchars gusting across<br>
the golf links;<br>
The tide far out<br>
and quail-grey in the distance; people<br>
jogging, or stopping to watch<br>
as the war planes cambered and turned<br>
in the morning light ‚Äì<br>
today - with the news in my mind, and the muffled dread<br>
of what may come ‚Äì I knelt down in the sand<br>
with Lucas gathering shells and pebbles finding evidence of life<br>
in all this<br>
driftwork: snail shells; shreds of razorfish;<br>
smudges of weed and flesh on tideworn stone.</p>
<p>At times I think what makes us who we are<br>
is neither kinship nor our given states<br>
but something lost between the world we own<br>
and what we dream about behind the names<br>
on days like this our lines raised in the wind<br>
our bodies fixed and anchored to the shore<br>
and though we are confined by property<br>
what tether us to gravity and light<br>
has most to do with distance and the shapes<br>
we find in water reading from the book<br>
of silt and tides the rose or petrol blue<br>
of jellyfish and sea anemone<br>
combining with a child‚Äôs<br>
first nakedness.</p>
<p>Sometimes I am dizzy with the fear<br>
of losing everything ‚Äì the sea, the sky,<br>
all living creatures, forests, estuaries:<br>
we trade so much to know the virtual<br>
we scarcely register the drift and tug<br>
of other bodies scarcely apprehend<br>
the moment as it happens: shifts of light<br>
and weather and the quiet, local forms<br>
of history: the fish lodged in the tide<br>
beyond the sands; the long insomnia<br>
of ornamental carp in public parks<br>
captive and hung in their own<br>
slow-burning transitive gold jamjars of spawn<br>
and sticklebacks or goldfish carried home<br>
from fairgrounds to the hum of radio<br>
but this is the problem: how to be alive<br>
in all this gazed-upon and cherished world<br>
and do no harm a toddler on a beach<br>
sifting wood and dried weed from the sand<br>
and puzzled by the pattern on a shell<br>
his parents on the dune slacks with a kite<br>
plugged into the sky all nerve and line<br>
patient; be afraid; but still, through everything<br>
attentive to the irredeemable.</p>
