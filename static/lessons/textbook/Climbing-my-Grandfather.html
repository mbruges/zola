<p>I decide to do it free, without a rope or net.<br>
First, the old brogues, dusty and cracked;<br>
an easy scramble onto his trousers,<br>
pushing into the weave, trying to get a grip.<br>
By the overhanging shirt I change<br>
direction, traverse along his belt<br>
to an earth-stained hand. The nails<br>
are splintered and give good purchase,<br>
the skin of his finger is smooth and thick<br>
like warm ice. On his arm I discover<br>
the glassy ridge of a scar, place my feet<br>
gently in the old stitches and move on.<br>
At his still firm shoulder, I rest for a while<br>
in the shade, not looking down,<br>
for climbing has its dangers, then pull<br>
myself up the loose skin of his neck<br>
to a smiling mouth to drink among teeth.<br>
Refreshed, I cross the screed cheek,<br>
to stare into his brown eyes, watch a pupil<br>
slowly open and close. Then up over<br>
the forehead, the wrinkles well-spaced<br>
and easy, to his thick hair (soft and white<br>
at this altitude), reaching for the summit,<br>
where gasping for breath I can only lie<br>
watching clouds and birds circle,<br>
feeling his heat, knowing<br>
the slow pulse of his good heart.</p>
