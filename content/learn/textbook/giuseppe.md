My Uncle Giuseppe told me  
that in Sicily in World War Two,  
in the courtyard behind the aquarium,  
where the bougainvillea grows so well,  
the only captive mermaid in the world  
was butchered on the dry and dusty ground  
by a doctor, a fishmonger, and certain others.  
  
She, it, had never learned to speak  
because she was simple, or so they’d said,  
but the priest who held one of her hands  
while her throat was cut,  
said she was only a fish, and fish can’t speak.  
But she screamed like a woman in terrible fear.  
  
And when they took a ripe golden roe  
from her side, the doctor said  
this was proof she was just a fish  
and anyway an egg is not a child,  
but refused when some was offered to him.  
  
Then they put her head and her hands  
in a box for burial  
and someone tried to take her wedding ring,  
but the others stopped him,  
and the ring stayed put.  
  
The rest they cooked and fed to the troops.  
They said a large fish had been found on the beach.  
  
Starvation forgives men many things,  
my uncle, the aquarium keeper, said,  
but couldn’t look me in the eye,  
for which I thank God.
