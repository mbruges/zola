<em>A boy needs his bongs</em></p><p>I love the BBC. But I do not love <a href=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds>BBC Sounds</a>.</p><p>It is clunky, it lacks automatic downloads, and it has an unbearable habit of advertising the podcast you are listening to <em>during said podcast</em>, with a bonus reminder that you can listen to the podcast <em>on the app you are currently using</em>.</p><p>As more and more BBC programmes vanish from open podcast platforms and into Sounds, the app feels increasingly like an attempt to build a content silo that is utterly unbecoming of a national broadcaster.</p><p>And yet: a licence-fee-payer has got to get his <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Time_Signal>pips</a>. But how?</p><p>Time to make our <em>own</em> Six O&rsquo;Clock News Podcast, with auto-downloads, FM-quality bongs and <em>no Sounds announcements</em>.</p><h2 id=crossing-the-streams>Crossing the streams<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#crossing-the-streams>#</a></h2><p>Back in the heady days of internet radio, Auntie gifted the world high-quality audio streams of all BBC radio stations. Sadly, these have started to disappear, though a few diehards still maintain lists of the working streams.</p><p>I won&rsquo;t post the streams here, but if you&rsquo;re interested I would recommend visiting the <a href=https://gist.github.com/bpsib/67089b959e4fa898af69fea59ad74bc3>Github</a> and trying your luck.</p><blockquote><p><a href=warning></a>These streams - and the steps discussed here - are strictly for <strong>personal use</strong>. As much as I find BBC Sounds objectionable and irritating, pirating BBC content is Not OK.</p></blockquote><h2 id=m3u8-to-m4a><code>.m3u8</code> to <code>.m4a</code><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#m3u8-to-m4a>#</a></h2><p>Now we have our stream, we need to capture it.</p><p>There are a few bespoke programs in the repos for capturing streams, but we&rsquo;re going to stick with the trusty workhorse of <code>FFMPEG</code>, for simplicity&rsquo;s sake (it&rsquo;s a quick <code>apt-get</code>, or <code>brew install</code> <a href=https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ffmpeg>for Mac</a>).</p><p>We pipe our stream in to <code>FFMPEG</code>, specify an output file, and it&rsquo;ll record away.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>$ ffmpeg -i https://a.bbc.stream/live/radio4.m3u8 6-oclock-news.mp3
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>Opening <span style=color:#e6db74>&#39;http://a.bbc.stream/live/radio4.m3u8&#39;</span> <span style=color:#66d9ef>for</span> reading

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Great! But I don&rsquo;t particularly want an endless MP3 file of Radio 4, or I may accidentally listen to <em>Moneybox</em>.</p><p>So, we set a flag to limit the recording to 30 minutes. While we&rsquo;re at it, we&rsquo;ll also set a bitrate - without this, we can easily end up with a file size into the hundred of MBs - and switch to our preferred format of <code>.m4a</code>, using <code>-c:a aac</code>. A bitrate of <code>128k</code> is more than sufficient for our purposes.</p><p>Our command now looks like this:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>$ ffmpeg -i https://a.bbc.stream/live/radio4.m3u8 -t 00:30:00 -c:a aac -b:a 128k 6-oclock-news.m4a
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>But a strange thing happens if you set this to run: after about 7 to 8 minutes, the recording will stop. With much painful debugging (<code>-loglevel</code> is your friend), the answer appears: the encoder is catching up with the end of the stream. When it does, it stops, satisfied with a job well done.</p><p>So, we need to add a couple more flags to let <code>FFMPEG</code> know that this is a <em>live</em> stream, and to keep going until our timer is up: <code>-re</code>. We can also add <code>-itsoffset</code> to give some breathing room between the encoding and the stream, as well as a <code>-reconnect</code> and an expanded buffer just to be safe. Our final command, then, is:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>ffmpeg -itsoffset <span style=color:#ae81ff>5</span> -re -reconnect <span style=color:#ae81ff>1</span> -i https://a.bbc.stream/live/radio4.m3u8 -t 00:30:00 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -rtbufsize 20M 6-oclock-news.m4a
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Save the command down into a handy script - something like <code>get-news.sh</code> - then set a cronjob to run it at 6pm every day: <code>0 18 * * * bash get-news.sh</code>. Obviously, you&rsquo;ll need your computer to be switched on for the duration of the recording. FFMPEG is light enough that it can easily run on a Pi: as good an excuse as any to dig it out from the drawer.</p><blockquote><p><a href=important></a>The streams tend to have a delay of 20-30 secs on them, so it&rsquo;s worth adding in a <code>sleep 15</code> at beginning of the script to account for this.</p></blockquote><h2 id=serving-the-podcast>Serving the podcast<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#serving-the-podcast>#</a></h2><blockquote><p><a href=tip-aside></a>Syncthing is super-easy to set up. <a href=https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html>Give it a go!</a></p></blockquote><p>As a quick and dirty way to get the files onto a phone for listening, Syncthing works perfectly; set it up to watch the folder containing the podcast audio files, and make sure Syncthing on the device is set up to receive them.</p><p>My preferred listening app is <a href=https://antennapod.org/>AntennaPod</a>: open-source and very snappy. For our purposes, it also has an easy method for adding local files: tap <code>Add podcast</code> then <code>Add local folder</code> to select the Syncthing folder containing the audio files. As soon as the files appear in the folder, they&rsquo;ll populate into your Episode feed (with the added bonus of being listenable offline).</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://mxb.fyi/static/personalpods.webp alt=pods></p><p>And <em>voila</em>: your own, FM-standard, <em>Sounds</em>-free <strong>6 O&rsquo;Clock News</strong>, with auto-downloads, immediately after broadcast.
