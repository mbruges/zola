<p>üó≥Ô∏è The Republic was led by <strong>The Senate</strong>, a sort of Parliament made up of all the powerful men in Rome, voting on decisions.</p>

<p>:watch: Consuls had strict <strong>limits</strong> on how long they could be in charge, and on what they could do.</p>
<p>üòà Above all, the Senate wanted to avoid one man having all the power in the city: a <strong>tyrant</strong>.</p>

<p>The Roman <strong>Republic</strong> was very successful; conquering its neighbours and expanding its control across the Mediterranean.</p>
