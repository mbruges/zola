Hello! What's all this here? A kitschy vase  
some Shirley Temple manqu√© has knocked out  
delineating tales of kids in cars  
on crap estates, the Burberry clad louts  
who flail their motors through the smoky night  
from Manchester to Motherwell or Slough,  
creating bedlam on the Queen's highway.  
Your gaudy evocation can, somehow,  
conjure the scene without inducing fright,  
as would a Daily Express expos√©,  
  
can bring to mind the throaty turbo roar  
of hatchbacks tuned almost to breaking point,  
the joyful throb of UK garage or  
of house imported from the continent  
and yet educe a sense of peace, of calm -  
the screech of tyres and the nervous squeals  
of girls, too young to quite appreciate  
the peril they are in, are heard, but these wheels  
will not lose traction, skid and flip, no harm  
befall these children. They will stay out late  
  
forever, pumped on youth and ecstasy,  
on alloy, bass and arrogance, and speed  
the back lanes, the urban gyratory,  
the wide motorways, never having need  
to race back home, for work next day, to bed.  
Each girl is buff, each geezer toned and strong,  
charged with pulsing juice which, even yet,  
fills every pair of Calvin‚Äôs and each thong,  
never to be deflated, given head  
in crude games of chlamydia roulette.  
Now see who comes to line the sparse grass verge,  
to toast them in Buckfast and Diamond White:  
rat-boys and corn-rowed cheerleaders who urge  
them on to pull more burn-outs or to write  
their donut Os, as signature, upon  
the bleached tarmac of dead suburban streets.  
There dogs set up a row and curtains twitch  
as pensioners and parents telephone  
the cops to plead for quiet, sue for peace -  
tranquility, though, is for the rich.  
  
And so, millennia hence, you garish crock,  
when all context is lost, galleries razed  
to level dust and we're long in the box,  
will future poets look on you amazed,  
speculate how children might have lived when  
you were fired, lives so free and bountiful  
and there, beneath a sun a little colder,  
declare *How happy were those creatures then,*  
*who knew the truth was all negotiable*  
*and beauty in the gift of the beholder.*
