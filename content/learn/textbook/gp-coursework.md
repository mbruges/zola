## Team Project/Element

### Step-by-step

1. The team selects a topic from the [topic list](#list-of-topics) and identifies a relevant local issue.
2. The team carries out research into the topic and local issue and into different perspectives on the local issue.
3. Each team member researches a different aspect, such as a different perspective.
4. Based on their research findings, and through discussion, the team decides on a course of action they might take to address the issue.
5. The team plans and carries out the action.
6. They measure the success of their action in addressing the issue.
7. The team also collaborates to write a planning document ‚Äì the Explanation of Research and Planning, which explains their decisions and planned actions.
8. They collaborate to produce the Evidence of Action.
9. Each **individual** team member also produces a Reflective Paper, in which they reflect on the whole project and their experiences and learning, and evaluate their teamwork and the action taken.

### List of Topics

- Arts in society
- Change in culture and communities
- Climate change, energy and resources
- Conflict and peace
- Development, trade and aid
- Digital world
- Education for all
- Employment
- Environment, pollution and conservation
- Globalisation
- Health and wellbeing
- Law and criminality
- Media and communication
- Migration and urbanisation
- Political power and action
- Poverty and inequality
- Social identity and inclusion
- Sport and recreation
- Technology, industry and innovation Transport, travel and tourism
- Values and beliefs
- Water, food and agriculture

### Example issues

<i>

- To reduce food waste in schools: an experiment involving school food services and an advertising campaign.
- To improve the lives of refugees: a drive to encourage school students to become pen-pals.
- To change attitudes to pollution: a litter pick in an area and a campaign to guide a town‚Äôs population.
- To improve disabled access to a local building: design and develop a means giving access to disabled people.
- To support local farmers with irrigation issues: to investigate irrigation globally and work with a local group of farmers to trial (an) innovative method(s).
- To support local equality: to work with local schools to teach basic English to young children.
- To support local education: to hold sports events in school where local schools without sports facilities can learn about and enjoy new sports.
- To support local homeless people: to hold a charity event to raise funds for a homeless charity.
- To support healthy eating: a campaign involving professional contributions and a school campaign to encourage healthy eating.

Once a team has decided on their project and their action, they must continue their research to ensure that their action can be carried out, e.g. using school facilities cannot be planned without the support of a Headteacher and maintenance teams, or interviewing people in a town, without parental permission.

### Planning document

*[Download sheet](/images/group-planning.webp)*

### Writing the Explanation

The Explanation of Research and Planning should include the following:
- the topic and the chosen local issue
- explanations for and details about team members‚Äô research tasks
- an explanation of how the team‚Äôs exploration of the issue and different perspectives has informed
decisions about the action
- a short description of the action
- details of roles and responsibilities in relation to the action
- a statement about how the action will be evidenced
- a statement about how the effectiveness of the project will be measured
- a final consideration of what, if anything, had to be changed as the project progressed.

> [](important) As the Team Project is a team effort, it should not just be left to one learner to organise and write everything. Throughout the process team members should be actively collaborating. 

### Writing the Personal Element ‚Äì Reflective Paper

This substantial piece of work attracts most of the marks for the Team Project component, with a total of up to 45 marks available. The Reflective Paper is written individually and is not a collaborative activity. 

The Reflective Paper should be no longer than 1000 words; any content beyond this will not be assessed. It must be written in the past tense. After the completion of the team elements, learners will explain their evaluations and reflections, using examples as evidence, and ensuring that they cover all requirements within the assessment criteria. Key personal research findings should focus on the research completed by the individual learner, rather than that of other group members. Reflections on their understanding may also include insights gained from research into the issue and perspectives explored by other team members.

This paper, or report, is distinct from an essay. As such, using sub-headings can be beneficial. Example sub-headings may include:
- Evaluation of the action
- Evaluation of own performance
- Reflection on learning
- Reflection on teamwork
- Developing understanding of different perspectives and research
- Key personal research findings and how they supported the project

### Marking criteria

#### A - Explanation of Research and Planning (AO1 Research, analysis and evaluation)

Four strands assess the clarity of planning. Each strand is assessed. For 10 marks to be awarded, the Explanation of Research and planning must:

- clearly identify the topic and the issue (Strand 1, 2 marks)
- detail a clear plan, including how the action will be evidenced and how its success will be measured
- clearly identify the roles and responsibilities of each team member (for research, planning, and the action)
- summarise the action the team will take to address the local issue.

#### B - Evidence of Action (AO1 Research, analysis and evaluation)

For 5 marks, the action is deemed to be very likely to make a positive difference to the issue, while the action was carried out very well.

#### C - Team Collaboration (AO3 Team Collaboration)

The syllabus and mark scheme identify key aspects of collaboration to include:

- clear communication between team members
- sharing useful ideas and developing the ideas of others
- agreeing targets and deadlines
- solving problems
- being flexible when required
- completing own tasks
- dividing tasks between team members and recognising all members‚Äô contributions
- asking for and giving support to others when needed.

The collaboration mark should be based solely on how well the team worked together during the process and should not be based on other factors such as:

- The product of the collaboration (how effective their action was)
- The Reflective Papers produced by the team.

For example:

- If the team works successfully together, communicates well with each other, coordinates their activities effectively, solves problems that they face during the project, and resolves group conflict successfully but their final action is not completely effective, they should still be awarded a high mark for collaboration despite the product of their collaboration being less successful.
- Alternatively, if one member of the team completes most of the work and the team does not collaborate effectively throughout the process, but due to the work of the one team member the action is effective, the team should be given a low mark for collaboration.

All members of the team are awarded the same team mark for Collaboration. Collaboration marks are awarded based on observation throughout the project.  

Table C has a single strand for marking. For 5 marks, the team has collaborated effectively throughout the project and resolved issues that have cropped up to the satisfaction of all team members.

#### D - Individual Collaboration (AO3 Collaboration)

All members of the team are also awarded an individual mark for Collaboration. Individual collaboration marks may vary within the team.  

Collaboration marks are awarded based on observation throughout the project. The mark must not be awarded for how much work any individual team member has undertaken, but rather for how well the individual has worked with the team. Therefore, if one learner from the team completed most of the work, then that individual should not achieve a high mark as they did not successfully collaborate with team members.

Learners should be made aware of what is meant by collaboration in this syllabus.  

Table D has a single strand for marking. For 5 marks, the individual learner consistently demonstrated the characteristics of an effective team-worker throughout the project, contributing, being flexible, supporting and being supported, and completing own tasks as agreed with the team.
