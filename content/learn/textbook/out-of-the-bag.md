## I  
  
All of us came in Doctor Kerlin's bag.  
He'd arrive with it, disappear to the room  
And by the time he'd reappear to wash  
  
Those nosy, rosy, big, soft hands of his  
In the scullery basin, its lined insides  
(The colour of a spaniel's inside lug)  
  
Were empty for all to see, the trap-sprung mouth  
Unsnibbed and gaping wide. Then like a hypnotist  
Unwinding us, he'd wind the instruments  
  
Back into their lining, tie the cloth  
Like an apron round itself,  
Darken the door and leave  
  
With the bag in his hand, a plump ark by the keel ...  
Until the next time came and in he'd come  
In his fur-lined collar that was also spaniel-coloured  
  
And go stooping up to the room again, a whiff  
Of disinfectant, a Dutch interior gleam  
Of waistcoat satin and highlights on the forceps.  
  
Getting the water ready, that was next‚Äî  
Not plumping hot, and not lukewarm, but soft,  
Sud-luscious, saved for him from the rain-butt  
And savoured by him afterwards, all thanks  
Denied as he towelled hard and fast,  
Then held his arms out suddenly behind him  
  
To be squired and silk-lined into the camel coat.  
At which point he once turned his eyes upon me,  
Hyperborean, beyond-the-north-wind blue,  
  
Two peepholes to the locked room I saw into  
Every time his name was mentioned, skimmed  
Milk and ice, swabbed porcelain, the white  
  
And chill of tiles, steel hooks, chrome surgery tools  
And blood dreeps in the sawdust where it thickened  
At the foot of each cold wall. And overhead  
  
The little, pendent, teat-hued infant parts  
Strung neatly from a line up near the ceiling‚Äî  
A toe, a foot and shin, an arm, a cock  
  
A bit like the rosebud in his buttonhole.  
  
  
## II  
  
Poeta doctus Peter Levi says  
Sanctuaries of Asclepius (called asclepions)  
Were the equivalent of hospitals  
  
In ancient Greece. Or of shrines like Lourdes,  
Says poeta doctus Graves. Or of the cure  
By poetry that cannot be coerced,  
  
Say I, who realized at Epidaurus  
That the whole place was a sanatorium  
With theatre and gymnasium and baths,  
  
A site of incubation, where "incubation"  
Was technical and ritual, meaning sleep  
When epiphany occurred and you met the god ...  
  
Hatless, groggy, shadowing myself  
As the thurifer I was in an open air procession  
In Lourdes in '56  
  
When I nearly fainted from the heat and fumes,  
Again I nearly fainted as I bent  
To pull a bunch of grass and hallucinated  
  
Doctor Kerlin at the steamed-up glass  
Of our scullery window, starting in to draw  
With his large pink index finger dot-faced men  
With button-spots in a straight line down their fronts  
And women with dot breasts, giving them all  
A set of droopy sausage-arms and legs  
  
That soon began to run. And then as he dipped and laved  
In the generous suds again, miraculum:  
The baby bits all came together swimming  
  
Into his soapy big hygienic hands  
And I myself came to, blinded with sweat,  
Blinking and shaky in the windless light.  
  
  
## III  
  
  
Bits of the grass I pulled I posted off  
To one going into chemotherapy  
And one who had come through. I didn't want  
  
To leave the place or link up with the others.  
It was mid-day, mid-May, pre-tourist sunlight  
In the precincts of the god,  
  
The very site of the temple of Asclepius.  
I wanted nothing more than to lie down  
Under hogweed, under seeded grass  
  
And to be visited in the very eye of the day  
By Hygeia, his daughter, her name still clarifying  
The haven of light she was, the undarkening door.  
  
## IV  
  
The room I came from and the rest of us all came from  
Stays pure reality where I stand alone,  
Standing the passage of time, and she's asleep  
  
In sheets put on for the doctor, wedding presents  
That showed up again and again, bridal  
And usual and useful at births and deaths.  
  
Me at the bedside, incubating for real,  
Peering, appearing to her as she closes  
And opens her eyes, then lapses back  
  
Into a faraway smile whose precinct of vision  
I would enter every time, to assist and be asked  
In that hoarsened whisper of triumph,  
  
"And what do you think  
Of the new wee baby the doctor brought for us all  
When I was asleep?"
