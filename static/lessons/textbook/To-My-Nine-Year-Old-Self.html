<p><em>by Helen Dunmore</em></p>
<p>You must forgive me. Don't look so surprised,<br>
perplexed , and eager to be gone<br>
balancing on your hands or on the tightrope<br>
You would rather run than walk, rather climb than run<br>
rather leap from a height than anything.</p>
<p>I have spoiled this body we once shared.<br>
Look at the scars, and watch the way I move,<br>
careful of a bad back or a bruised foot.<br>
Do you remember how, three minutes after waking<br>
we'd jump straight out of the ground floor window<br>
into the summer morning</p>
<p>That dream we had, no doubt it's as fresh in your mind<br>
as the white paper to write it on.<br>
We made a start, but something else came up -<br>
a baby vole, or a bag of sherbet lemons -<br>
and besides that summer of ambition<br>
created an ice-lolly factory, a wasp trap<br>
and a den by a cesspit</p>
<p>I'd like to say we could be friends<br>
but the truth is we have nothing in common<br>
beyond a few shared years. I won't keep you then.<br>
Time to pick rosehips for tuppence a pound,<br>
time to hide down scared lanes<br>
from men in cars after girl-children<br>
or to lunge out over the water<br>
on the rope that swings from that tree<br>
long buried in housing -<br>
But no, I shan't cloud your morning. God knows<br>
I have fears enough for us both -</p>
<p>I leave you in an ecstasy of concentration<br>
slowly peeling a ripe scab from your knee<br>
to taste it on your tongue.</p>
