After the fair, I‚Äôd still a light heart  
and a heavy purse, he struck so cheap.  
And cattle doted on him: in his time  
mine only dropped heifers, fat as cream.  
Yields doubled. I grew fond of company  
that knew when to shut up. Then one night,  
   
disturbed from dreams of my dear late wife,  
I hunted down her torn voice to his pale form.  
Stock-still in the light from the dark lantern,  
stark-naked but for one bloody boot of fox-trap,  
I knew him a warlock, a cow with leather horns.  
To go into the hare gets you muckle sorrow,  
   
the wisdom runs, muckle care. I levelled  
and blew the small hour through his heart.  
The moon came out. By its yellow witness  
I saw him fur over like a stone mossing.  
His lovely head thinned. His top lip gathered.  
His eyes rose like bread. I carried him  
   
in a sack that grew lighter at every step  
and dropped him from a bridge. There was no  
splash. Now my herd‚Äôs elf-shot. I don‚Äôt dream  
but spend my nights casting ball from half-crowns  
and my days here. Bless me Father for I have sinned.  
It has been an hour since my last confession.
