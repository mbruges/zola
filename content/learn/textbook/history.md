_St Andrews: West Sands; September 2001_  
  
Today as we flew the kites -  
the sand spinning off in ribbons along the beach  
and that gasoline smell from Leuchars gusting across  
the golf links;  
The tide far out  
and quail-grey in the distance; people  
jogging, or stopping to watch  
as the war planes cambered and turned  
in the morning light ‚Äì  
today - with the news in my mind, and the muffled dread  
of what may come ‚Äì I knelt down in the sand  
with Lucas gathering shells and pebbles finding evidence of life  
in all this  
driftwork: snail shells; shreds of razorfish;  
smudges of weed and flesh on tideworn stone.  
  
At times I think what makes us who we are  
is neither kinship nor our given states  
but something lost between the world we own  
and what we dream about behind the names  
on days like this our lines raised in the wind  
our bodies fixed and anchored to the shore  
and though we are confined by property  
what tether us to gravity and light  
has most to do with distance and the shapes  
we find in water reading from the book  
of silt and tides the rose or petrol blue  
of jellyfish and sea anemone  
combining with a child‚Äôs  
first nakedness.  
  
Sometimes I am dizzy with the fear  
of losing everything ‚Äì the sea, the sky,  
all living creatures, forests, estuaries:  
we trade so much to know the virtual  
we scarcely register the drift and tug  
of other bodies scarcely apprehend  
the moment as it happens: shifts of light  
and weather and the quiet, local forms  
of history: the fish lodged in the tide  
beyond the sands; the long insomnia  
of ornamental carp in public parks  
captive and hung in their own  
slow-burning transitive gold jamjars of spawn  
and sticklebacks or goldfish carried home  
from fairgrounds to the hum of radio  
but this is the problem: how to be alive  
in all this gazed-upon and cherished world  
and do no harm a toddler on a beach  
sifting wood and dried weed from the sand  
and puzzled by the pattern on a shell  
his parents on the dune slacks with a kite  
plugged into the sky all nerve and line  
patient; be afraid; but still, through everything  
attentive to the irredeemable.
